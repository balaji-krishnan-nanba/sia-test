SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.3
RECOGNISING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 20 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 4.3 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE UNIT
--------
Unit 4: Terror Threat Awareness for Close Protection
- Assessment: Portfolio-based
- Chapters: 5
- Practice Questions: 102 total
- This chapter (4.3) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 4

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Early recognition of suspicious activity can prevent terrorist attacks.
CPOs are uniquely positioned to observe hostile reconnaissance against
principals. Understanding what to look for, how to assess behaviour, and
how to report concerns is essential for protective security.

Why Recognise It:
- Terrorists MUST conduct surveillance
- Detection can prevent attack
- Disrupts hostile planning cycle
- Opportunity to report
- Protect principal

Who Conducts Hostile Reconnaissance:

TERRORIST OPERATIVES:

- Lone actors
- Less sophisticated
- Opportunistic
- Variable behaviour

When It Occurs:
- Days, weeks, or months before attack
- Multiple sessions
- Different times
- Different observers possible

What They Observe:

ABOUT TARGET:
- Routines and patterns

- Detection can prevent attack

COUNTER vs ANTI SURVEILLANCE:
- COUNTER = DETECTING surveillance (finding watchers)
- ANTI = PREVENTING surveillance (stopping them watching)

HOT PROTOCOL:

- O = Is it OBVIOUSLY suspicious?
- T = Is it TYPICAL for this location?

ANTI-TERRORIST HOTLINE:
- 0800 789 321
- Confidential
- 24 hours
- Non-emergency reporting

ACT CAMPAIGN:

- Unusual interest in security
- Questions about procedures
- Note-taking
- Out of place behaviour

IF SUSPICIOUS ITEM FOUND:
- DO NOT touch
- DO NOT use radio nearby
- Move away calmly
- Clear area
- Call police

SURVEILLANCE DETECTION ROUTE (SDR):
- Pre-planned route
- Forces surveillance to reveal itself
- Trigger points and checkpoints
- Unnatural features

WHAT TO REPORT:
- Description of person
- Vehicle details
- Behaviour observed
- Time and location

- Confront hostile surveillance (wrong - report, don't confront)
- Touch suspicious item to examine (wrong - never touch)
- HOT means Hot Object Test (wrong - Hidden, Obviously suspicious, Typical)
