BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer
- 60 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 90 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (42 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.4) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Controlling who enters and leaves a site is fundamental to security. 
Security officers must manage access points effectively to prevent 
unauthorised entry, theft, and security breaches while maintaining smooth 
flow for legitimate visitors. Poor access control can compromise the 
entire security of a premises.
