A) Supermarket loyalty card
B) Bank card
C) Student union card without a PASS logo
D) UK passport

Q4 | Difficulty: Easy

Question: When a venue reaches its maximum licensed capacity, a door supervisor should:

A) Operate a one-in-one-out system and not exceed capacity
B) Only allow in people who know the manager
C) Allow in small groups if they promise to behave
D) Let more people in for a short time to reduce the queue

Answer: A
Explanation: Capacity limits are set by law, usually through a fire risk assessment, and must never be exceeded. When the venue is full, a one-in-one-out system must be used; going over the limit is a criminal offence and creates serious safety risks.

A) Location of the manager's office
B) Location of all fire exits and escape routes
C) Price list for drinks

B) Photocopied and kept in a notebook
C) Left in the manager's office for safekeeping
D) Worn openly where it can be easily seen, such as on a lanyard or clip

Answer: D
Explanation: A condition of holding an SIA licence is that it must be worn and displayed clearly while on duty, unless there is a specific approved exemption. Keeping it hidden or locked away does not meet this requirement.

Question: While checking IDs at the entrance, a customer who looks about 20 approaches. What is the MOST appropriate action under a Challenge 25-type policy?

A) Allow them entry because they are probably over 18
B) Ask for valid photo ID to prove their age
C) Ask their friends to confirm how old they are
D) Refuse entry immediately without explanation

Answer: B

C) It is only acceptable if the customer is also intoxicated
D) It is acceptable only if the customer is not a regular

Answer: A

B) Immediately eject them using physical force
C) Monitor them closely and inform colleagues or management of your concerns

C) Close the door and refuse to let anyone leave
D) Leave the venue to look for the police

C) Ask them to wait until the end of the night so the venue is less busy
D) Ensure they have clear, safe access to the casualty and assist with crowd control as directed

C) Cooperate, showing them any counters, clickers or records used to monitor numbers
D) Ask customers if they are happy for the officer to inspect before allowing access

Answer: C

Q13 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: Your venue is at its licensed capacity and you are operating a one-in-one-out system. A group of ten arrives with a well-known local celebrity who has been booked to appear. At the same time, you notice that one of the fire exits is partially blocked by customers smoking. What should be your TOP priority?

A) Allow the celebrity and their group straight in to avoid bad publicity
B) Ask the DJ to stop the music so the celebrity can be announced
C) Immediately ensure the fire exit is cleared and kept unobstructed, while maintaining the one-in-one-out system
D) Temporarily exceed capacity to let the group in, then reduce numbers later

Answer: C
Explanation: Safety always comes before reputation, queues or VIPs. Fire exits must be kept clear at all times and capacity limits must not be exceeded. The correct response is to clear and protect the exit and continue to control admission within the legal capacity.

Q14 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You recognise a person in a group of six approaching the door as someone who is on the venue's banned list for previous violence. The rest of the group appear calm and sober. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Allow the whole group in but keep an eye on the banned person
B) Refuse entry only to the banned person, clearly explaining the ban, and allow the rest of the group in if they meet entry conditions
C) Refuse entry to the entire group without explanation
D) Let the banned person in if they promise to behave

Answer: B
Explanation: Bans should be applied consistently to the individual concerned and recorded with reasons, often as part of venue or Pubwatch/Clubwatch schemes. The banned person should be refused entry and the decision explained calmly; the others can be admitted if they meet all entry conditions, though they may choose to leave with their friend.

Q15 | Difficulty: Hard

Question: After a serious assault outside your venue, you provide a factual statement to police officers, including what you saw on CCTV. Later that night, a friend of the suspect demands to know exactly what you told the police and threatens to complain if you refuse. What is the MOST appropriate response?

A) Tell them everything you told the police to avoid confrontation
B) Refuse to speak to them at all and walk away without explanation
C) Calmly explain that you have a duty to cooperate with the police and cannot discuss details of the investigation, and direct them to management if they wish to complain
D) Show them the CCTV so they can see what happened

Answer: C
Explanation: Door supervisors must cooperate with police investigations and also maintain confidentiality about incidents and customer information. The best response is to remain calm, explain your duty to assist the police, avoid sharing details with third parties and signpost any complaint through the proper venue procedures.
