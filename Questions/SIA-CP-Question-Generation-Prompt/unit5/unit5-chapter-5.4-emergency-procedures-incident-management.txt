UNIT 5, CHAPTER 5.4: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the FIRST action a door supervisor should take upon discovering 
a fire?

A) Fight the fire with an extinguisher
B) Raise the alarm
C) Search for trapped people
D) Open all windows for ventilation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The first action upon discovering a fire is to RAISE THE 
ALARM. This ensures everyone is alerted and evacuation can begin 
immediately. Fighting the fire should only be attempted if trained and 
it's safe to do so, and only after raising the alarm. Searching for 
people is done during evacuation, not before alerting others.
