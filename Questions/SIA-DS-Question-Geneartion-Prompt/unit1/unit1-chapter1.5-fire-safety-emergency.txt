FIRE SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 55 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 1.5 of 
Unit 1 of the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

Take your time. Quality over speed.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

WHAT IS THE SIA?
----------------
The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is the UK government body responsible for 
regulating the private security industry. Door Supervisors must hold a valid 
SIA licence to work legally.

THE EXAM STRUCTURE
------------------
Unit 1: Working in the Private Security Industry
- 72 multiple choice questions in the actual exam
- 110 minutes duration
- 71% pass mark (51 correct answers required)

This chapter (1.5) focuses on fire safety, emergency procedures, and 
counter-terrorism awareness - critical knowledge for door supervisors who 
are often first responders in emergency situations.

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Door supervisors are frequently the first to:
- Discover a fire
- Respond to emergencies
- Coordinate evacuations
- Liaise with emergency services
- Notice suspicious behaviour (terrorism)

Getting this right saves lives. Getting it wrong costs lives.

CHAPTER 1.5: FIRE SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
-------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 55
(22 easy, 22 medium, 11 hard)

TOPICS YOU MUST COVER:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.5.1: FIRE SAFETY LEGISLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005:
- Primary fire safety legislation in England and Wales
- Applies to ALL non-domestic premises
- Replaced many previous fire safety laws
- Risk-based approach
- Enforced by Fire and Rescue Services

Key Concepts:

THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON:
- Has duties under the Order
- Usually the employer, owner, or occupier
- Or anyone with control of premises
- May be multiple responsible persons
- Door supervisor is NOT usually the responsible person
- But must follow their instructions

Duties of Responsible Person:
- Carry out fire risk assessment
- Implement fire safety measures
- Maintain fire safety measures
- Develop emergency plan
- Provide fire safety training
- Appoint competent persons for fire safety

FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Legal requirement
- Identify fire hazards
- Identify people at risk
- Evaluate, remove, reduce risks
- Record (if 5+ employees)
- Review regularly

Fire Authority Powers:
- Inspect premises
- Issue enforcement notices
- Issue prohibition notices (close premises)
- Prosecute for breaches
- Penalties: fines, imprisonment

Door Supervisor Fire Duties:
- Know the fire evacuation procedure
- Know location of fire exits and equipment
- Act on discovering fire
- Assist with evacuation
- Prevent re-entry
- Liaise with fire service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.5.2: THE FIRE TRIANGLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The three elements needed for fire:

        HEAT
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /______\
   FUEL      OXYGEN

HEAT (Ignition Source):
- Naked flames
- Electrical equipment
- Sparks
- Friction
- Hot surfaces
- Smoking materials

FUEL (Combustible Material):
- Paper, cardboard, wood
- Textiles (curtains, furniture)
- Plastics
- Flammable liquids
- Gases
- Waste materials

OXYGEN:
- Air (approximately 21% oxygen)
- Some chemical oxidising agents
- Always present in normal environment

Principle:
- Fire requires ALL THREE elements
- Remove ANY ONE element = fire cannot burn
- Basis of fire prevention and firefighting

Prevention - Remove Elements:
- Control ignition sources (no smoking, electrical safety)
- Reduce fuel (housekeeping, safe storage)
- Cannot easily remove oxygen from environment

Extinguishing - Remove Elements:
- Cooling (removes heat) - water
- Smothering (removes oxygen) - foam, CO2
- Starving (removes fuel) - fire breaks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.5.3: CLASSES OF FIRE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASS A - ORDINARY COMBUSTIBLES:
- Solid materials
- Wood, paper, cloth, plastics, rubber
- Most common type of fire
- Usually leave ash
- Memory: A = Ash

CLASS B - FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS:
- Petrol, diesel, oil
- Paints, solvents, spirits
- Burn on surface of liquid
- Memory: B = Barrels (of liquid)

CLASS C - FLAMMABLE GASES:
- Propane, butane
- Natural gas, methane
- Acetylene
- MUST isolate gas supply
- Memory: C = Cylinders (gas)

CLASS D - COMBUSTIBLE METALS:
- Magnesium, sodium, potassium
- Aluminium powder
- Titanium
- Rare, specialist extinguishers needed
- Memory: D = Dangerous metals

CLASS F - COOKING OILS AND FATS:
- Chip pan fires
- Deep fat fryers
- Kitchen oils
- Very high temperature
- Specific extinguisher required
- Memory: F = Fat Fryers

ELECTRICAL FIRES:
- Not a class of its own
- Fires INVOLVING electrical equipment
- Must switch off electricity first if safe
- Then treat as underlying class
- Some extinguishers safe on electrical

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.5.4: FIRE EXTINGUISHER TYPES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WATER (RED LABEL):
- Colour: All red body
- Use on: CLASS A only
- Action: COOLING - removes heat
- Never use on: Electrical, flammable liquids, cooking fats
- Danger: Water conducts electricity, spreads liquid fires, 
  causes explosion with fat fires

FOAM (CREAM/BEIGE LABEL):
- Colour: Red body with cream band
- Use on: CLASS A and CLASS B
- Action: SMOTHERING and COOLING
- Creates foam blanket over fire
- Never use on: Chip pan fires
- Some rated for electrical use (check label)

CO2 - CARBON DIOXIDE (BLACK LABEL):
- Colour: Red body with black band
- Use on: CLASS B and ELECTRICAL fires
- Action: SMOTHERING - displaces oxygen
- Leaves no residue
- Warning: Horn gets extremely cold (-70°C)
- Warning: Fire may re-ignite (no cooling effect)
- Warning: Limited use in open air

DRY POWDER (BLUE LABEL):
- Colour: Red body with blue band
- Use on: CLASS A, B, C and ELECTRICAL
- Most versatile extinguisher
- Action: Chemical reaction interrupts combustion
- Warning: Creates visibility problems (powder cloud)
- Warning: Does not cool - fire may re-ignite
- Warning: Powder is irritant - not for enclosed spaces
- Never use on: Chip pan fires

WET CHEMICAL (YELLOW LABEL):
- Colour: Red body with yellow band
- Use on: CLASS F (cooking oils/fats)
- Also effective on: CLASS A
- Action: SAPONIFICATION - creates soap layer, COOLING
- ONLY extinguisher for chip pan/deep fat fryer fires
- Specifically designed for commercial kitchens
- Memory: Yellow = Cooking (think of yellow oil/butter)

COLOUR MEMORY AID:
| Type | Label Colour | Think... |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Water | Red (all red) | Red = danger (only Class A) |
| Foam | Cream | Cream foam |
| CO2 | Black | Black = no oxygen (smothers) |
| Powder | Blue | Blue powder |
| Wet Chemical | Yellow | Yellow cooking oil |

CRITICAL RULE - CHIP PAN FIRES:
- ONLY use WET CHEMICAL (yellow)
- NEVER use water (explosion)
- NEVER use foam (ineffective)
- NEVER use CO2 (ineffective)
- NEVER use powder (ineffective)
- If no wet chemical: DO NOT fight - evacuate

================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
Which colour label identifies a CO2 (carbon dioxide) fire extinguisher?

A) Red
B) Cream
C) Black
D) Blue

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: CO2 extinguishers have a black label on a red body. The colour 
coding is: Red (all red) = Water, Cream = Foam, Black = CO2, Blue = Dry 
Powder, Yellow = Wet Chemical.

---

Question 2 [Easy]
What are the three elements of the fire triangle?

A) Heat, fuel, and water
B) Heat, fuel, and oxygen
C) Flames, smoke, and oxygen
D) Ignition, combustion, and fuel

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The fire triangle consists of heat (ignition source), fuel 
(combustible material), and oxygen. Removing any one element will prevent 
fire from starting or will extinguish an existing fire.

---

Question 3 [Medium]
A fire breaks out in a commercial kitchen deep fat fryer. Which extinguisher 
should be used?

A) Water (red label)
B) CO2 (black label)
C) Dry powder (blue label)
D) Wet chemical (yellow label)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Class F fires (cooking oils and fats) should ONLY be tackled 
with a wet chemical extinguisher (yellow label). Water causes explosive 
steam and fat splatter, and other extinguishers are ineffective or dangerous 
on cooking oil fires.
