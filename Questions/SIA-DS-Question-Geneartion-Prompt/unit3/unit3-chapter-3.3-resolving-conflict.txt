CHAPTER 3.3: RESOLVING CONFLICT - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 20
- Easy (direct recall): 8 questions
- Medium (application): 8 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.1: CONFLICT RESOLUTION APPROACHES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five Conflict Resolution Styles:

1. COMPETING (Win-Lose):
- Assertive and uncooperative
- Pursuing your goals at expense of other
- Using power, authority
- "My way"
- When: Emergency, safety issues, clear rules

2. ACCOMMODATING (Lose-Win):
- Unassertive and cooperative
- Giving in to other person
- Sacrifice your position
- "Your way"
- When: Issue not important to you, maintaining relationship

3. AVOIDING (Lose-Lose):
- Unassertive and uncooperative
- Withdrawing from conflict
- Not addressing the issue
- "No way"
- When: Issue trivial, emotions too high, need time

4. COMPROMISING (Partial Win-Partial Win):
- Moderate assertiveness and cooperation
- Finding middle ground
- Both give something up
- "Halfway"
- When: Equal power, temporary solution needed

5. COLLABORATING (Win-Win):
- Assertive and cooperative
- Working together for mutual solution
- Satisfies both parties
- "Our way"
- When: Important issues, time available, relationship matters

Door Supervisor Context:
- Competing often necessary (rules must be upheld)
- Collaboration ideal but not always possible
- Avoiding appropriate when issue minor
- Compromise can work (different solution, not rule-breaking)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.2: PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step-by-Step Problem Solving:

1. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM:
- What is the actual issue?
- Not the symptoms
- Get to core concern
- Ask questions

2. GATHER INFORMATION:
- Listen to all sides
- Understand perspectives
- What do they want?
- What do you need?

3. GENERATE OPTIONS:
- What are the possible solutions?
- Be creative
- Don't dismiss ideas immediately
- Involve the other person

4. EVALUATE OPTIONS:
- What works for everyone?
- What's realistic?
- What are consequences?
- What fits within rules?

5. CHOOSE SOLUTION:
- Select best option
- Explain reasoning
- Get agreement if possible
- Be clear about outcome

6. IMPLEMENT:
- Put solution into action
- Clear expectations
- Follow through
- Monitor outcome

Example in Practice:
Person refused entry for dress code.
Problem: Wants to enter, dress code violated.
Options: Go home and change, buy appropriate item nearby, entry to bar area only (if venue allows), accept refusal.
Solution: Offer alternative venue area if possible, or clear explanation of policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.3: ASSERTIVENESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Assertiveness:
- Standing up for your rights
- While respecting others' rights
- Clear, direct communication

Assertive vs Aggressive:

ASSERTIVE:
- Firm but fair
- Respects the other person
- Explains reasoning
- Open to discussion
- Controls emotions
- Seeks resolution

AGGRESSIVE:
- Hostile and dominating
- Disrespects the other person
- Commands without explanation

- Seeks to win/dominate

Assertive vs Passive:

PASSIVE:
- Gives in too easily
- Doesn't stand ground
- Avoids conflict at cost of position
- Doesn't enforce rules
- Can be exploited
- Seen as weak

Assertive Techniques:

BROKEN RECORD:
- Calmly repeat your position

- "I understand, but the policy is..."
- Persistence without aggression

FOGGING:
- Agree with any truth in criticism
- Without giving in on main point
- "You may be right that the wait is long, but..."
- Deflects without escalating

NEGATIVE ASSERTION:
- Accept criticism if valid
- "You're right, I should have explained that better"
- Disarms aggression
- Shows maturity

I STATEMENTS:
- "I need you to..." not "You must..."
- Ownership of your position
- Less confrontational
- More likely to get cooperation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.4: SETTING BOUNDARIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Boundaries Matter:
- Define acceptable behaviour
- Create predictability
- Maintain safety
- Uphold rules consistently

Clear Boundaries:
- State clearly what's expected
- State consequences of not complying
- Be specific
- Be consistent

Example:
"Sir, I need you to lower your voice. If you continue shouting, I'll have 
to ask you to leave."
- Clear expectation: lower voice
- Clear consequence: being asked to leave
- Respectful: "Sir"
- Gives choice: they can comply

Following Through:
- Must deliver on stated consequences
- If you don't, credibility lost
- Be prepared to act
- Only state consequences you can/will enforce

Consistency:
- Same rules for everyone
- Same consequences
- No favouritism
- Builds respect and trust

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.5: MANAGING THE OUTCOME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Outcomes:

1. VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE:

4. POLICE INVOLVEMENT:

- Allow reasonable time

Escort:
- Professional manner
- Minimum intervention needed

- Watch for aggression

At the Door:

- Safely removing yourself from situation
- Tactical withdrawal
- Not the same as running away
- Strategic decision

BETTER OPTION AVAILABLE:
- Call police instead

How to Disengage:

CREATE DISTANCE:

TOPIC 3.3.7: MEDIATION ROLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Door Supervisor as Mediator:

CONFIDENTIALITY:
- What's said in mediation
- Not shared widely
- Builds trust
- Encourages openness

VOLUNTARY:

- Can walk away

Basic Mediation Steps:

1. SEPARATE parties initially
2. LISTEN to each side
3. IDENTIFY common ground
4. EXPLORE options
5. AGREE way forward
6. CHECK commitment

Reality Check:
- Door supervisors are not trained mediators
- Complex disputes need proper resolution
- Your role is limited
- Focus on immediate safety and separation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.8: USE OF FORCE CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Force May Be Necessary:
- Self-defence
- Defence of others
- Prevention of crime
- Lawful arrest
- Ejecting trespasser

Continuum of Response:
1. Presence (just being there)
2. Verbal (communication, commands)
3. Soft control (guiding, escorting)
4. Hard control (restraint holds)
5. Defensive strikes (last resort)

Match Response to Threat:
- Minimum force necessary
- Proportionate to threat
- Escalate only if required
- De-escalate when possible

Remember:
- Force is LAST resort
- Communication should be tried first
- Force must be legally justified
- Must be reasonable and proportionate
- Covered in detail in Unit 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.3.9: ENDING INTERACTIONS POSITIVELY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where Possible:

Thank for Cooperation:

- "I appreciate your patience"
- Ends on positive note
- Maintains relationship

Explain Outcome:
- Brief explanation if appropriate
- Not an apology if right
- Understanding helps acceptance
- Reduces future conflict

Future Relationship:
- "Hopefully see you again when..."
- "Next time, if you..."
- Leaves door open
- Not burning bridges

Where Resolution Not Positive:

Stay Professional:
- Even when they're angry
- Don't match negative energy
- You represent the venue
- Dignity maintained

Clear Ending:
- Definite conclusion
- No ambiguity
- Expectations clear
- Move on

Self-Protection:
- Document incident
- Witness statements

UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.3: RESOLVING CONFLICT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
Which conflict resolution style involves both parties working together to 
find a solution that satisfies everyone?

A) Competing
B) Compromising
C) Collaborating
D) Accommodating

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Collaborating (win-win) involves both parties working together 
to find a mutually satisfying solution. This requires high assertiveness and 
high cooperation. Compromising finds a middle ground where both give something 
up, while competing is win-lose and accommodating is lose-win.
