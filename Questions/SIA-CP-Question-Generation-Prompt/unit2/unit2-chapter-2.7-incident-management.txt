SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.7
INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 25 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.7 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 6-7 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Close Protection Operative
- 30 multiple choice questions
- 45 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (21 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.7) is one of 8 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
When incidents occur, there is no time to think - only to act. CPOs must 
have pre-trained responses to attacks, medical emergencies, fires, and 
other incidents. Incident management training creates automatic responses 
that save lives.

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.7: INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
In close protection, what is ALWAYS the first priority during any incident?

A) Preserving evidence
B) Reporting to police
C) Principal safety
D) Team coordination

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Principal safety is ALWAYS the first priority during any 
incident in close protection. All other considerations - team safety, 
evidence preservation, reporting, and coordination - come after ensuring 
the principal is safe. This fundamental principle guides all incident 
response decisions.
