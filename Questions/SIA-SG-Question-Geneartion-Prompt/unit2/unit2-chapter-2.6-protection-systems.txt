SIA SECURITY GUARD - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.6
ELECTRONIC AND PHYSICAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 30 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.6 of 
the SIA Security Guard Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 7-8 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer
- 60 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 90 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (42 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.6) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Modern security relies heavily on electronic and physical systems. Security 
officers must understand how these systems work, their capabilities and 
limitations, and how to respond to activations. Proper use of security 
systems enhances protection, while failure to understand them can leave 
premises vulnerable.

Question 1 [Easy]
What does PIR stand for in relation to alarm detection devices?

A) Personal Infrared Reader
B) Passive Infrared
C) Pressure Indicated Response
D) Perimeter Intruder Recognition

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: PIR stands for Passive Infrared. These detectors work by 
sensing changes in infrared (heat) energy, typically detecting body heat 
from a person moving through the detection area. They are one of the most 
common types of intruder detection devices.

- DVR/NVR for recording
- Legal requirements (signage, data protection)

ACCESS CONTROL:
- Card, PIN, biometrics
- Multi-factor more secure
- Tailgating is a common weakness

FIRE DETECTION:
- Smoke detectors (ionisation, optical)
- Heat detectors
- Manual call points
