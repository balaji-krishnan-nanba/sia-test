UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.4: PHYSICAL INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the correct angle for the interview stance relative to the threat?

A) Square on (0 degrees)
B) Bladed (approximately 45 degrees)
C) Side on (90 degrees)
D) Back turned (180 degrees)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The correct stance is BLADED at approximately 45 degrees to 
the threat. This reduces the target area you present, provides better 
balance, and allows for quick movement in any direction. A square-on 
stance presents a larger target and is more confrontational.
