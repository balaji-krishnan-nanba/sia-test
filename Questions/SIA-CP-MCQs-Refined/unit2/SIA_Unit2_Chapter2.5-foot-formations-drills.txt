UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.5: FOOT FORMATIONS AND DRILLS
Question 1 [Easy]
In a standard four-person box formation, what is the primary duty of the FRONT (point) CPO?
A) Clearing the path ahead and identifying forward threats
B) Monitoring individuals following behind the principal
C) Carrying the principal’s personal items
D) Providing crowd control on the left flank
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
In a box formation, the front (point) CPO leads the formation. Their primary role is to clear the path, identify and manage threats within the forward 180° arc, and set the pace and direction of travel. Rear and flank positions deal with people behind or to the sides.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which of the following BEST describes the main purpose of close protection foot formations?
A) To make the team look professional and impressive
B) To reduce the amount of paperwork after the task
C) To provide coordinated 360-degree protection around the principal
D) To allow CPOs to stay as close together as possible
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The core purpose of foot formations is to create a coordinated protective “bubble” around the principal, giving 360° coverage, clear responsibilities, and an organised response to threats, while allowing smooth movement.

Question 3 [Easy]
The diamond formation is MOST appropriate for which situation?
A) Driving the principal between venues
B) Moving a principal through a dense crowd in a clear forward direction
C) Standing static while the principal gives a speech
D) Moving in single file up a narrow staircase
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The diamond formation is directional and has a narrower profile than the box. It works well when moving through crowds in a defined direction, with the point clearing the path and the tail maintaining rear security.

Question 4 [Easy]
The V-formation (wedge) is primarily designed for:
A) Covert work in very low-threat environments
B) Short, aggressive forward movement such as entering venues or approaching vehicles
C) Long-distance patrolling around a large estate
D) Providing maximum rear protection during static events
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The V-formation is an aggressive, forward-focused formation. It is ideal for short movements where the team needs to “punch” through a group—such as entering a venue, approaching a vehicle, or moving through a compact crowd—while shielding the principal behind the point.

Question 5 [Easy]
Single file formation is MOST suitable when:
A) Providing a very obvious security presence at a press line
B) Standing still while the principal gives a media interview
C) Moving through narrow corridors, doorways, or staircases
D) Operating in a wide public square with plenty of space
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Single file is used for temporary transition through narrow spaces where other formations will not physically fit—such as corridors, doorways, and stairs. Once clear, the team should revert to a more protective formation.

Question 6 [Easy]
In a two-person team moving along a corridor, which arrangement BEST provides both path clearance and rear security?
A) Both CPOs side by side, with the principal walking behind them
B) One CPO in front of the principal and one behind the principal
C) One CPO on each side, with the principal walking ahead of them
D) Both CPOs behind the principal in single file
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
With only two CPOs, one should lead (clearing the path and dealing with forward threats) while the other follows behind (monitoring anyone approaching from the rear). This front-and-rear setup maximises coverage with limited resources.

Question 7 [Easy]
When ASCENDING a staircase with a principal, how should the usual three-person order be arranged?
A) Point first, principal in the middle, rear CPO last
B) Rear CPO first, then the principal, then the point
C) Principal alone, with the team remaining at the bottom
D) Principal first, followed by the point, then the rear CPO
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
When going up stairs, the point goes first to clear the route, the principal follows, and the rear CPO provides cover from behind and below. This maintains protection in both directions while safely moving the principal.

Question 8 [Easy]
An armed threat suddenly appears ahead of the principal. What should the team’s IMMEDIATE priority be?
A) Report to the operations room before moving the principal
B) Challenge the threat verbally while the principal stands still
C) Cover and evacuate the principal away from the threat
D) Take photographs or video for evidence
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
On an armed threat, the first priority is to protect life: body-shield the principal and evacuate them along the safest route. Communication and evidence-gathering come after the principal has been moved away from immediate danger.

Question 9 [Easy]
When moving through a dense crowd, how should the team’s formation normally change?
A) Spread wider away from the principal to appear less obvious
B) Move into a loose single file with the principal in front
C) Tighten around the principal, keeping CPOs closer in
D) Drop back to increase distance from the principal
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
In crowds, threats can be concealed and movement is restricted. The team should tighten their formation, keeping close to the principal to create a protective “bubble” and prevent the crowd from pressing directly onto them.

Question 10 [Easy]
In normal operating conditions with no specific threat identified, what spacing is generally appropriate between CPOs and the principal?
A) Medium spacing of around 2–3 metres
B) No consistent spacing is required
C) Close spacing at arm’s length only
D) Wide spacing of 5+ metres
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Medium spacing (roughly 2–3 metres) is typical in normal conditions. It maintains a protective posture without crowding the principal, and still allows the team to close in quickly if the threat level rises.

Question 11 [Medium]
A four-person team is escorting a principal across a wide open plaza at a public event. The threat level is medium to high, and they want full 360° coverage with clear responsibilities. Which formation is MOST appropriate?
A) Single file with the principal leading
B) Two-person staggered formation
C) Three-person V-formation with no rear cover
D) Four-person box formation around the principal
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The box formation places four CPOs around the principal (front, rear, left flank, right flank), giving clear 360° coverage and role allocation. This suits open spaces and higher threat levels when sufficient team members are available.

Question 12 [Medium]
Compared with a box formation, what is a key advantage of the diamond formation when moving through a crowd in a set direction?
A) It requires only three CPOs rather than four
B) It lets the principal walk outside the formation for visibility
C) It provides better rear coverage than the box
D) It gives a narrower, more directional profile with the point clearing the path ahead
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The diamond is more directional and has a narrower profile than the box, making it effective for moving forward through crowds. The point leads and clears the path, while the sides and tail maintain flank and rear security.

Question 13 [Medium]
A principal must move 20 metres from a vehicle to a building entrance through a cluster of photographers pressing forward. The team has THREE CPOs and wants a short, aggressive burst of forward movement with strong shielding. Which formation is BEST?
A) Single file with the point in front and two CPOs behind the principal
B) Four-person box formation with wide spacing
C) Three-person V-formation with a point and two flanks forming a wedge in front of the principal
D) Loose two-person parallel formation
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
A three-person V-formation places a point at the front and two flanks forming a wedge, with the principal just behind the point. This shape drives through a cluster and shields the principal from frontal and lateral pressure during short moves.

Question 14 [Medium]
A team in a box formation must pass briefly through a narrow doorway before returning to the box. Which of the following BEST describes good practice?
A) Send the principal through alone first, then reform behind them
B) Temporarily move into single file (point → principal → rear), then smoothly re-form the box once through
C) Keep the box formation and push everyone through the doorway at the same time
D) Break formation and walk through individually without re-forming
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The correct drill is to adapt the formation to the environment: compress to single file to pass through the bottleneck, then quickly and smoothly re-establish the original formation on the other side.

Question 15 [Medium]
A two-person team is escorting a principal along a moderately busy shopping-centre corridor. They need both path clearance and protection from anyone following. Where should the REAR CPO position themselves?
A) Immediately in front of the principal, sharing lead duties
B) A short distance behind the principal, monitoring people approaching from the rear
C) Several metres ahead of the lead CPO to extend coverage forward
D) Directly beside the principal on the opposite side to the lead CPO
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
With two CPOs, the rear CPO should sit slightly behind the principal, watching the rear arc and anyone following, while being close enough to support the lead CPO and help evacuate the principal if needed.

Question 16 [Medium]
When approaching a blind 90° corner in an indoor corridor, how should the POINT CPO manage the turn?
A) Step back into the formation and let the rear CPO lead the turn
B) Turn sharply with no change in pace to avoid drawing attention
C) Slow slightly, visually check around the corner first, then lead the formation round while maintaining coverage
D) Allow the principal to reach the corner first to see if it is safe
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The point should control the turn: reduce speed slightly, check around the corner for threats, then lead the formation through while maintaining arcs of observation and keeping the principal shielded.

Question 17 [Medium]
During a short, high-pressure move of about 15 metres from a building entrance to a vehicle through a compact pushing crowd, the team has FOUR CPOs and wants an aggressive wedge with some rear cover. Which formation is MOST suitable?
A) Box formation with wide spacing
B) Two-person staggered formation
C) Single file with the principal at the front
D) Four-person V-formation with a point, two flanks, and a rear cover around the principal
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
A four-person V-formation keeps the point pushing forward, two flanks widening or narrowing as required, and a rear cover protecting from behind. This gives an aggressive “snowplough” effect while still maintaining some rear protection.

Question 18 [Medium]
While walking in formation, an agitated individual approaches the principal shouting but not yet making physical contact. According to contact drills, what should the NEAREST CPO do FIRST?
A) Ignore the person unless they produce a weapon
B) Walk away and leave the individual to event staff
C) Intercept and position themselves between the person and the principal, assessing and trying to de-escalate verbally
D) Immediately push the principal to the ground for cover
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
On verbal contact, the nearest CPO should step in as a physical and psychological barrier, intercepting the person, assessing intent, and attempting verbal de-escalation while protecting the principal and alerting the team.

Question 19 [Medium]
When DESCENDING a staircase with a principal, what is the MAIN role of the REAR CPO?
A) To guard the area above and behind, controlling anyone following
B) To walk beside the principal, holding the handrail for them
C) To move several steps ahead of the principal to speed up movement
D) To reach the bottom first and clear the landing
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
When going down stairs, the rear CPO focuses on threats and hazards from above and behind—such as people following too closely—while the point CPO manages the area below.

Question 20 [Medium]
At a concert, the density of the crowd suddenly increases around the principal and there is a risk of crowd crush. What should the team do?
A) Split up to find separate paths out of the area
B) Hold position and wait for the crowd to calm
C) Close the formation around the principal, identify the nearest safe exit route, and extract decisively through the crowd
D) Ask the principal to negotiate directly with the crowd to create space
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Crowd crush is a serious hazard. The team should tighten around the principal, identify the safest and quickest exit path, and move decisively, with the point clearing the way and flanks maintaining a protective buffer.

Question 21 [Hard]
A four-person team in a box formation is moving along a pavement when a man 5 metres ahead suddenly produces a knife and runs towards the principal from the front. The team leader shouts “CONTACT FRONT”. Which response BEST reflects close protection contact drills?
A) All team members step back behind the principal and wait for police to arrive
B) The team immediately splits up, each CPO moving in a different direction to confuse the attacker
C) The rear CPO turns to look for other threats while the principal confronts the attacker
D) The front CPO moves towards and engages the threat to create space (“attack the attack”) while flanks and rear body-shield and evacuate the principal away
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
“Attack the attack” means moving towards the threat to disrupt and create distance for the principal. The front CPO engages the attacker, while the others shield and evacuate the principal. The priority remains cover and evacuation, coordinated by clear commands.

Question 22 [Hard]
A high-profile principal is leaving a theatre via a wide pavement where hostile protesters are present on BOTH sides of the route. Threat level is high and the team has four CPOs. They need strong lateral and rear protection for a 40-metre walk to a vehicle. Which formation is MOST suitable?
A) Single file formation with the principal at the front
B) Loose two-person staggered formation
C) Four-person box formation tightly around the principal
D) Three-person V-formation with one rear cover
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
With protesters on both sides and a high threat level, the box formation is ideal: it gives strong lateral, forward, and rear protection with four CPOs forming a close human shield around the principal.

Question 23 [Hard]
A team is using a diamond formation to move a principal through a busy shopping street. The crowd thins out ahead, but there is an increased risk of someone following closely behind. To maintain effective coverage, how should the TAIL position prioritise their role?
A) Move up beside the principal to act as an additional flank
B) Monitor and control anyone following behind, maintaining rear security and the integrity of the diamond
C) Leave the formation entirely and observe from a distance
D) Take over from the point and lead navigation while the point drops back
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
In a diamond, the tail’s primary role is rear security—watching and managing anyone following the formation and ensuring it remains intact. As the rear threat increases, this responsibility becomes even more critical.

Question 24 [Hard]
During a walkabout, a popular principal wants to greet well-wishers in a moderate crowd. Threat level is medium. Which approach BEST balances the principal’s desire to interact with the public and the team’s crowd management responsibilities?
A) Maintain a tight formation “bubble” around the principal, allowing controlled, brief interactions while monitoring behaviour and staying ready to intervene
B) End all contact immediately and remove the principal from the area at the first sign of any approach
C) Move the principal alone to the edge of the crowd while the team stays back to appear less intrusive
D) Open the formation completely so the public can surround the principal freely
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The team should create a controlled “bubble,” allowing limited, managed interaction while monitoring behaviour and being ready to intervene or extract if needed. Not everyone in a crowd is a threat, but control and observation remain essential.

Question 25 [Hard]
A two-person team is escorting a principal from a hotel lobby to a car in a LOW-THREAT, low-profile environment. The principal wants security to be as discreet as possible, but the team still needs both forward and rear awareness. Which deployment is MOST appropriate?
A) Place one CPO immediately beside the principal and send the second ahead to the car alone
B) Both CPOs walk very close, directly in front of the principal in a visible shield
C) Have both CPOs walk several metres behind the principal so they are almost invisible
D) Use a staggered formation with one CPO slightly ahead and to one side and the other slightly behind on the opposite side, blending in while maintaining observation
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
A staggered two-person formation (front-left/rear-right or similar) provides both forward and rear observation while appearing more natural and discreet in a low-threat, low-profile setting. It balances security with the principal’s desire to blend in.
