A) To provide evidence that can support criminal or civil proceedings
B) To give management something to read on quiet days
C) To make the incident sound more dramatic to colleagues

Question: When should you normally complete an incident report?

A) As soon as possible after the incident, ideally on the same shift
B) Only if the police ask for one
C) At the end of the week, when you have time
D) The next time you are on duty, even if it is several days later

A) "The male was acting aggressively and looked dangerous."
B) "The male probably wanted to start a fight."
C) "The male seemed like trouble as soon as he arrived."

A) "Wearing casual clothes."
B) "Wearing a dark top and trousers."
C) "Looked smartly dressed."
D) "Wearing a blue denim jacket, white T-shirt, black jeans and white trainers."

Answer: D
Explanation: Descriptions should be specific and detailed. "Blue denim jacket, white T-shirt, black jeans and white trainers" gives a clear picture and helps identify the person. The other options are too vague or subjective.

Q6 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: You discover a small pool of blood on the floor after an assault inside the venue. What should you AVOID doing before police arrive, unless there is an immediate safety risk?

A) Preventing customers walking through the area
B) Cleaning up the blood so it looks better for customers
C) Noting where the blood is and any nearby items

Explanation: Blood and other signs of violence can be important evidence. You should not clean them up before police have a chance to examine or photograph the scene, unless there is a serious safety or health risk.

Q7 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Why should witnesses to an incident be kept separate from each other wherever possible?

A) So they do not become friends
B) To stop them blaming each other
C) So the police have fewer people to talk to
D) To prevent them influencing each other's account of what happened

Answer: D
Explanation: If witnesses discuss the incident together, they may influence each other's memories and create a "group story". Keeping them separate helps each person give an independent, more reliable account.

Q12 | Difficulty: Medium

Question: After breaking up a fight on the dance floor, you see a knife lying on the floor nearby. The area has been cordoned off and secured. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Carefully pick up the knife with your bare hands and place it in a bin out of sight
B) Leave the knife where it is, keep people away from the area and inform management and the police
C) Kick the knife under a nearby stage so no one steps on it
D) Wipe the knife clean with a cloth and give it to the manager

Answer: B
Explanation: Once an area is secured and cordoned, the knife should be left in place as evidence. Moving or touching it could compromise forensic evidence. Inform police of its exact location. You should avoid touching or moving potential weapons unless absolutely necessary for safety. The best option is to keep the area secure, prevent contamination and inform management and the police so the item can be recovered properly.

Q14 | Difficulty: Medium

Question: After a disturbance, a group of four friends tell you they all saw what happened but are about to leave. What is the BEST way to manage them as potential witnesses?

A) Ask one of them what happened and tell the others so they can agree a story
B) Ask them to wait together at the bar and discuss the incident while you call the police
C) Take each person's name and contact details and, if they are willing to stay, keep them separate and do not discuss what you saw
D) Let them leave; the police can work out who they are from CCTV later

Answer: C
Explanation: Witnesses should be identified and their contact details recorded. If they can stay, they should be kept separate and not influenced by your account or each other's discussions. This helps preserve independent evidence.

Question: You and a colleague have moved an injured customer away from broken glass after a serious assault. Other customers are still walking through the area where there is blood and glass on the floor. What is the BEST next step to preserve the crime scene while waiting for the police?

D) Move all tables and chairs back into their normal positions to keep the walkway clear

Answer: C
Explanation: Once the injured person is safe, you should protect the scene by preventing access and documenting what you see. Do not clean up blood or move items unnecessarily, as this can destroy or disturb evidence.

D) Throw the bottle straight into the general rubbish bin outside the venue

Answer: C
Explanation: You may need to move an item for safety, but handling should be kept to a minimum. If you do move it, you should note its original position, handle it carefully to reduce contamination, secure it safely and record who has handled it.
