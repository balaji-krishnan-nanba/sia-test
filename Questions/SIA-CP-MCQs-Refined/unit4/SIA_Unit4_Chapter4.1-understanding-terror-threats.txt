UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.1: UNDERSTANDING TERRORISM AND THREAT LEVELS

Question 1 [Easy]
What does a UK threat level of CRITICAL mean?

A) An attack is possible but not likely
B) An attack is highly likely
C) An attack is expected imminently
D) An attack is unlikely

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
CRITICAL is the highest UK national threat level and means an attack is expected imminently. It is usually based on specific intelligence that an attack is very likely in the near future. At this level, CPOs should consider maximum protective measures, including reviewing or even postponing operations if the risk cannot be adequately controlled. 
GOV.UK

Question 2 [Easy]
As a CPO working in the UK, which option best reflects the legal definition of terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000?

A) Use or threat of action designed to influence government or intimidate the public, for a political, religious, racial or ideological cause
B) Any serious criminal activity that causes fear in the public
C) Any violent act carried out by a foreign national
D) Any act of violence involving explosives

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 defines terrorism as the use or threat of action designed to influence the government or an international organisation, or to intimidate the public, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. Other serious crimes may cause fear, but without this ideological purpose they are not terrorism in law.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which organisation is primarily responsible for setting the UK national threat level for international terrorism?

A) MI5 (the Security Service)
B) JTAC (Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre)
C) MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service)
D) GCHQ

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The national threat level for international terrorism is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), which is based within MI5 but operates as a multi‑agency body. JTAC analyses intelligence from many sources and provides an independent assessment that informs protective security planning, including CP operations. 
MI5

Question 4 [Easy]
Which of the following is the clearest example of single‑issue extremism?

A) A group seeking to establish a global religious caliphate
B) A dissident republican group opposing British presence in Northern Ireland
C) A neo‑Nazi organisation promoting a white‑only state
D) An extremist group targeting laboratories involved in animal testing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Single‑issue extremism focuses on one specific cause, such as animal rights, the environment or anti‑abortion campaigns. Targeting laboratories because they conduct animal testing is typical single‑issue terrorism. The other options reflect broader ideological movements (Islamist extremism, Northern Ireland‑related, and extreme right‑wing).

Question 5 [Easy]
Which strand of the UK’s CONTEST counter‑terrorism strategy is mainly about stopping people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism?

A) PREVENT
B) PURSUE
C) PROTECT
D) PREPARE

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
PREVENT aims to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism by addressing the radicalisation process and providing early intervention and support. PURSUE focuses on stopping attacks, PROTECT on strengthening security, and PREPARE on mitigating the impact of an attack. 
GOV.UK

Question 6 [Easy]
You check the MI5 website before an assignment and see the threat level is MODERATE. What does this mean?

A) An attack is unlikely
B) An attack is possible but not likely
C) An attack is likely
D) An attack is highly likely

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
A MODERATE threat level means an attack is possible but not likely. It is lower than SUBSTANTIAL (likely) and SEVERE (highly likely), but still requires normal professional vigilance from a CPO, especially in crowded or symbolic locations. 
GOV.UK

Question 7 [Easy]
In the context of terrorism, what is radicalisation?

A) Any involvement in political activity
B) Joining any protest movement
C) The process by which a person adopts extremist views that may lead them to support or commit terrorism
D) Becoming more interested in current affairs and the news

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Radicalisation is the process through which an individual comes to adopt extremist ideas and attitudes that may eventually lead them to support or engage in terrorism. It can be gradual, may occur online or in person, and can affect people from any background. Recognising this process early is important for CPOs. 
Home Office Media

Question 8 [Easy]
Which option best describes a lone‑actor terrorist?

A) A member of a large terrorist organisation directed from overseas
B) A state intelligence officer conducting covert operations
C) A group of local extremists acting together in small cells
D) An individual who plans and carries out an attack alone, often self‑radicalised

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
A lone‑actor terrorist is an individual who plans and conducts an attack by themselves, often after self‑radicalisation online. They may be inspired by wider movements but act without direct operational tasking, making them harder for authorities – and for CPOs – to detect and disrupt.

Question 9 [Easy]
Your principal is due to open a new fashion store in a large city. Which location would generally be considered a soft target from a terrorism point of view?

A) A crowded shopping centre where members of the public can freely attend the launch event
B) A military barracks with controlled access and armed guards
C) A police headquarters with secure perimeter and screening
D) A secure underground government bunker

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Soft targets are locations that are crowded, publicly accessible and difficult to secure, such as shopping centres, concerts or public events. These offer terrorists high casualty potential and media impact. In contrast, military bases, police HQs and secure bunkers are usually hardened targets with strong security.

Question 10 [Medium]
You are team leader for a CP operation at a high‑profile awards evening. On the day, the national threat level is raised from SUBSTANTIAL to SEVERE. What is the most appropriate response?

A) Cancel all operations immediately and send the principal home, regardless of other factors
B) Review the operation, introduce additional protective measures and brief the team and principal, continuing only if the risk is still manageable
C) Make no changes; SEVERE is routine and does not affect CP planning
D) Rely entirely on venue security and police and continue as planned

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
SEVERE means an attack is highly likely, so a CPO should carry out a dynamic risk assessment, enhance security (e.g. more thorough search, revised routes, additional vehicles), and ensure the principal understands the situation. Blanket cancellation without assessment may be disproportionate; doing nothing is negligent.

Question 11 [Medium]
Intelligence indicates that a group of UK‑based extremists, with no operational links to foreign organisations, is planning an attack inside the UK. Planning, funding and target selection are all domestic. How is this best described?

A) International terrorism
B) State‑sponsored terrorism
C) Domestic terrorism
D) Cybercrime

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
This scenario describes domestic terrorism, where the threat comes from within the state itself – in this case, UK‑based individuals or groups acting without overseas direction. International terrorism would involve direction or control from abroad, while state‑sponsored terrorism is backed by a nation state.

Question 12 [Medium]
One of the venue security staff working near your principal has:

Started expressing support for violent extremist groups online

Justified recent terrorist attacks in conversation

Become more withdrawn from their usual social circle

As a CPO, what is the most likely concern from a terrorism perspective?

A) They are definitely planning an imminent attack
B) They have already committed a terrorism offence
C) They pose no terrorism‑related risk at this stage
D) They may be undergoing radicalisation and could become vulnerable to involvement in terrorism

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
The changes described – support for extremist groups, justification of violence and social withdrawal – are typical warning signs of radicalisation. They do not prove an imminent attack or a specific offence, but they are serious enough to warrant concern and reporting through appropriate channels.

Question 13 [Medium]
A group detonates a device outside a government ministry and issues a statement demanding that specific legislation is repealed. Which primary motivation does this most clearly demonstrate?

A) Political objectives
B) Financial gain
C) Random criminal violence
D) Purely religious conversion

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Targeting a government ministry and linking the attack directly to demands about legislation is aimed at changing government policy, which is a political objective. While religion, revenge or publicity may sometimes play a part, the core motivation here is political.

Question 14 [Medium]
For Northern Ireland‑related terrorism, who sets the official UK threat level?

A) JTAC (Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre)
B) MI5 (the Security Service)
C) The Home Office
D) Local Police Service of Northern Ireland

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
MI5 is responsible for setting the threat level for Northern Ireland‑related terrorism, based on intelligence and assessment of the capability and intent of terrorist groups. JTAC sets the national threat level for international terrorism. 
MI5

Question 15 [Medium]
You are advising on security for a new corporate HQ used regularly by your principal. The company installs hostile vehicle mitigation, improved access control, CCTV coverage and a robust search regime at entrances. Which CONTEST strand do these measures primarily support?

A) PREVENT
B) PURSUE
C) PROTECT
D) PREPARE

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Physical measures like vehicle barriers, access control and screening are part of PROTECT, which aims to strengthen protection against a terrorist attack by making targets harder to access and reducing their vulnerability. PREVENT deals with radicalisation, PURSUE with investigation and disruption, and PREPARE with response and recovery. 
GOV.UK

Question 16 [Medium]
Your principal is attending a major outdoor music festival. There is no intelligence that they are a specific target, but large public events are known to be attractive to terrorists. What type of terrorism risk does this most clearly represent for your principal?

A) Targeted risk
B) Personal grievance risk
C) Economic target risk
D) Collateral risk

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Here the principal is not the specific objective of the attackers, but could be harmed if an indiscriminate attack is carried out on the crowded event. This is a collateral risk: the principal may be caught up in an attack aimed at the venue or crowd rather than at them personally.

Question 17 [Medium]
During planning for a high‑profile charity gala, you organise a full‑scale exercise with venue staff and emergency services to test evacuation, casualty management and communication in the event of a terrorist attack. Which CONTEST strand does this most closely relate to?

A) PREPARE
B) PREVENT
C) PROTECT
D) PURSUE

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Running exercises to test and improve emergency response, evacuation and recovery arrangements is part of PREPARE, which aims to mitigate the impact of a terrorist attack and support resilience and recovery afterwards.

Question 18 [Medium]
You suspect that a young member of hotel staff regularly working near your principal is being radicalised. As a CPO working in the UK, what is the most appropriate action?

A) Confront them directly and try to “de‑radicalise” them yourself
B) Report your concerns through your company chain of command and/or to the police, in line with Prevent and safeguarding procedures
C) Ignore it unless you personally witness them committing an offence
D) Post your concerns about them on social media to warn others

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The UK Prevent duty expects relevant professionals to have “due regard” to the need to prevent people being drawn into terrorism. For a CPO, this means recognising concerns and reporting them through appropriate channels, not conducting your own investigation or confrontation. Prevent and Channel provide structured, multi‑agency support where needed. 
Legislation.gov.uk

Question 19 [Hard]
An extreme right‑wing group carries out a bomb attack on a multicultural community centre. In an online statement they say their aim is to “drive minorities out”, “show the government is weak” and “spark a wider conflict that will make people join our cause”. From a terrorism awareness perspective, what strategic objective are they mainly trying to achieve?

A) Obtaining immediate financial gain from the attack
B) Avoiding media attention and remaining unknown
C) Influencing wider society and government by creating fear, undermining confidence and inspiring supporters
D) Only harming the individuals physically present at the community centre

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
While the attack harms those at the centre, the statement shows the group’s real goal is strategic: to intimidate communities, undermine confidence in the state and attract more supporters to their ideology. Terrorism aims to influence a wider audience beyond the immediate victims by creating fear and provoking reactions.

Question 20 [Hard]
Your principal’s company is fitting out a new flagship office that will host high‑profile events. You want specialist advice on protective security against terrorism, including building design and crowded‑place security. Which organisation is most appropriate to provide this guidance?

A) MI6 (Secret Intelligence Service)
B) GCHQ
C) MI5 (the Security Service)
D) NaCTSO (National Counter Terrorism Security Office)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
NaCTSO provides specialist protective security advice and guidance to businesses and organisations on reducing vulnerability to terrorism, particularly in crowded places. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are intelligence agencies; they may contribute to overall threat assessment, but NaCTSO is the main point of contact for practical security advice relevant to CP planning. 
Counter Terrorism Policing

Question 21 [Hard]
A teacher raises concerns about a 15‑year‑old who is spending large amounts of time online with extremists, sharing violent material and talking about “wanting to do something big”. The case is referred for voluntary, multi‑agency early intervention support. Which programme is this most likely to involve?

A) PREVENT (as a whole strategy)
B) Channel
C) CONTEST
D) PURSUE

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Channel is the UK’s multi‑agency, voluntary early‑intervention programme for individuals at risk of being drawn into terrorism. It sits under the Prevent strand of CONTEST and brings together professionals to assess risk and provide tailored support. 
GOV.UK

Question 22 [Hard]
Your principal plans to travel by train through a major city where the national threat level is SEVERE and recent attacks have targeted crowded transport hubs. Which planning approach best integrates terrorism awareness into your CP operation?

A) Conduct detailed advance work on stations and routes, identify alternative travel options, build in contingency and evacuation plans, and maintain real‑time communication with police and rail security
B) Cancel all train travel permanently and refuse any movement until the threat level returns to LOW
C) Rely entirely on visible police presence at stations and make no changes to your normal procedures
D) Focus solely on close‑quarters body‑cover drills around the principal and ignore wider environmental risks

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
At SEVERE, attacks are highly likely, so the best approach is a proportionate, intelligence‑led plan: thorough advance work, options for rerouting or alternative transport, clear contingencies, and liaison with transport and police partners. Completely stopping all movement may be unrealistic, while ignoring wider environmental risks is unsafe.
