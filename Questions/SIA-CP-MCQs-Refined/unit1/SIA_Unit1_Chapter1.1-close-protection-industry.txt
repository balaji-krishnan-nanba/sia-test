A) Executive protection
B) Event security
C) Family protection

Question 7 [Easy]

A) The employer is responsible for paying all of their tax
B) They must always work for a single agency only
C) They are responsible for their own tax and National Insurance

Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Freelance or self‑employed CPOs usually work for multiple clients or agencies and are responsible for managing their own tax, National Insurance and business expenses, rather than receiving employee benefits.

Question 8 [Easy]
What is the MAIN reason the SIA requires close protection operatives to hold a valid licence?
A) To ensure only military veterans can work in CP
B) To regulate the industry and ensure operatives meet minimum competency and vetting standards
C) To allow CPOs to carry firearms in the UK

SIA licensing ensures operatives meet minimum training and vetting standards to protect public safety and maintain professional standards in the private security industry. The licensing requirement applies to all CPOs regardless of background.

Question 9 [Medium]
A newly qualified CPO wants to build a good reputation on The Circuit. Which approach is MOST likely to help them secure repeat work?
A) Always turning up on time, performing professionally, and maintaining contact with good operators and companies after each task
B) Posting regular photos with clients on social media to show how “busy” they are
C) Only accepting high‑risk international work so their CV looks impressive
D) Frequently changing companies so they can say they have worked for many different firms
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
On The Circuit, reputation is built on reliability, professionalism and networking. Being consistently dependable and staying in professional contact leads to recommendations and repeat bookings.

Question 10 [Medium]
A licensed CPO in the UK is offered extra work at a nightclub. Which of the following roles can they normally perform without obtaining an additional SIA licence, due to licence integration?
A) CCTV (Public Space Surveillance) operator
B) Door Supervisor on the nightclub entrance
C) Key‑holding patrol officer
D) Vehicle immobiliser
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The SIA allows licence integration so that a Close Protection licence also covers certain related activities, including Door Supervision and Security Guarding, but not CCTV operation or key‑holding only roles. Get Licensed+1

Question 11 [Medium]
You are tasked to protect a famous singer on a UK arena tour. The main concerns are large crowds, over‑enthusiastic fans and possible stalkers, plus heavy media attention. What type of close protection work is this?
A) Executive protection
B) Diplomatic protection
C) Celebrity protection
D) Family protection
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Protecting entertainers or sports stars with a high public profile, fan issues and media interest is celebrity protection, often involving event venues and tours.

Question 12 [Medium]
A fellow operative posts in a private social media group: "Just landed in Paris with a very high‑profile client for a 3‑day shopping trip!" By revealing the client's location, travel dates and purpose, which professional principle has they MOST directly breached?
A) Integrity
B) Professional conduct
C) Personal security awareness
D) Confidentiality
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Confidentiality specifically requires never sharing client information, locations, movements or travel details - even in supposedly "private" groups and even without naming the client. This post directly reveals where the client is, how long they will be there, and what they are doing, which is a clear and specific breach of confidentiality obligations.

Question 13 [Medium]
A freelance CPO is offered a 10‑day overseas assignment via an agency. Before booking flights, what is the MOST important item they should ensure is clearly stated in the written contract?
A) Insurance cover and liability for injury, loss or damage during the assignment
B) The preferred colour and style of business suit for the team
C) Whether the hotel has a gym and spa facilities
D) Whether all other team members are from the same country as the principal
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
While appearance details can be agreed later, insurance and liability provisions are critical. The contract should clearly define who is responsible for medical, legal and financial liabilities if something goes wrong.

Question 14 [Medium]
A CPO wants to specialise as a security driver, focusing on route planning, anti‑ambush drills and safe extraction under pressure. Which additional training would be MOST appropriate?
A) Firearms training abroad
B) Defensive/evasive driving
C) Covert surveillance techniques
D) Maritime security operations
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A security driver role requires advanced defensive and evasive driving skills, including vehicle control, route selection and emergency manoeuvres, making this the most appropriate specialist training.

Question 15 [Medium]
Which of the following assignments would require the MOST comprehensive advance planning and specialist risk assessment?
A) Static residential security at a UK property with existing security systems
B) Executive protection for UK-based office meetings with low threat profile
C) Close protection during routine shopping trips in a familiar UK city
D) Close protection in a conflict-affected region with poor infrastructure and limited medical facilities
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Hostile or unstable environments require extensive planning including: local intelligence, secure routes, medical evacuation options, communication systems, and contingency plans for infrastructure failure. While all CP work requires planning, high-risk overseas environments demand significantly more comprehensive preparation.

Question 16 [Medium]
Why did the UK introduce statutory regulation of the private security industry, including close protection, through the SIA?
A) To guarantee all CPOs had a military background
B) To ensure CPOs could routinely carry firearms in the UK
C) To improve standards and public safety by licensing security operatives and activities
D) To reduce competition from overseas security companies
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The SIA’s role, created under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, is to license and regulate private security to raise standards, reduce criminality and improve public safety. GOV.UK

Question 17 [Hard]
You are planning a 2‑week close protection task in a country with political instability, poor infrastructure and limited medical facilities. Apart from normal UK planning, which action is MOST critical to include?
A) Developing a detailed advance plan including local intelligence, secure routes, medical facilities and emergency evacuation options
B) Ordering matching branded polo shirts so the team looks professional on arrival
C) Reducing the team size to keep the client’s travel and accommodation costs as low as possible
D) Relying on the hotel’s own security and medical services to handle any emergencies
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Hostile or unstable environments require intelligence‑led advance planning: route analysis, local contacts, medical facilities and evacuation plans. Appearance and cost are secondary to robust risk management and contingency planning.

Question 18 [Hard]
A freelance operative has completed their CP training but their SIA Close Protection licence application is still being processed. A company offers them immediate work on a full CP task and says, “You can work under our licence for now.” What should the operative do?
A) Accept the role because they will be supervised by licensed operatives
B) Refuse to undertake licensable close protection activities until their own SIA licence has been granted
C) Accept the role but avoid working in public places
D) Start the work and apply for a backdated licence once approved
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
In the UK, it is a criminal offence to carry out licensable close protection activities without holding a valid SIA licence in your own name, and employing unlicensed staff is also an offence. The operative must not start CP duties until licensed. GOV.UK+1

Question 19 [Hard]
You are team leader on a long‑term executive protection detail. One team member repeatedly arrives late, appears scruffy and complains about pay in front of the client’s staff. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Ignore it as long as the principal’s physical safety is not affected
B) Publicly criticise the team member in front of the principal to show strong leadership
C) Speak to the team member privately, reinforce standards, document the issue and, if it continues, consider removing them from the detail
D) Immediately report the team member to the client and ask for them to be dismissed without discussion
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Professional standards require the team leader to protect the client relationship and team reputation. Addressing the behaviour privately, recording it, and escalating only if it continues balances fairness with maintaining high professional standards.

Question 20 [Hard]
A CPO with 8 years’ operational experience wants to progress into roles such as Team Leader, Operations Manager or Security Director over the next five years. Which strategy is MOST likely to support this goal?
A) Only accepting the highest‑paid tasks to maximise income quickly
B) Focusing mainly on weapons training overseas, even though they work in the UK
C) Leaving the security sector completely to gain experience in an unrelated job
D) Gaining supervisory experience, completing further management and planning training, and building a strong professional network and reputation
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Progression into senior roles depends on leadership experience, formal development (e.g. management, planning, specialist courses) and a strong reputation and network in the industry, rather than purely chasing higher pay or unrelated experience.
