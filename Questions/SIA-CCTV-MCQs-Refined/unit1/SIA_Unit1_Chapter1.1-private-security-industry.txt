Question 4 [Easy]
Which ONE of the following situations definitely requires an SIA Public Space Surveillance (CCTV) licence?

A) A homeowner watching their own domestic CCTV cameras on a mobile phone.

Question 10 [Easy]
When you are working in a CCTV control room in a licensable role, what must you do with your SIA licence?

A) Lock it away in a locker so it cannot be seen
B) Leave it at home as long as your supervisor knows your licence number
C) Have it with you and display it so it can be seen unless there is a specific operational reason not to
D) Only bring it in if the police ask to see it

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Front line SIA licences are issued as photocard badges that must be worn or kept with you while you are working, and must be produced on request by authorised persons. They are intended to be visible so that the public, employers and enforcement officers can confirm you are properly licensed.

Question 11 [Medium]
Raj is employed directly by a national supermarket chain. His job is to sit in the back office and watch cameras that only cover the inside of his own store and staff‑only areas. Under normal circumstances, does he need an SIA Public Space Surveillance (CCTV) licence for this role?

A) Yes, because anyone who watches CCTV at work must have an SIA licence
B) No, because he is working in‑house for his own employer on their premises only
C) Yes, but only on Saturdays
D) No, because supermarket CCTV is never licensable, even for contracted staff

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: SIA guidance states that you do not usually need a licence when working in‑house (directly employed by the organisation that uses your services), such as a supermarket employing its own staff to monitor its own cameras. A licence is generally required where there is a contract for services and the work involves a licensable activity.

Question 12 [Medium]
A security company supplies CCTV operators under contract to run a town‑centre control room. One operator’s SIA licence has expired but they are still put on shift to monitor cameras. Under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, what offence might the company be committing?

A) None, because the operator used to be licensed
B) Only the individual operator can commit an offence in this situation
C) Only the local authority client could be prosecuted
D) Employing an unlicensed person to carry out licensable activities, which is a criminal offence for the employer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: As well as it being an offence for an individual to work without a licence, the Act also makes it an offence for an employer to engage or deploy unlicensed people in licensable roles. Both the company and the individual can face criminal proceedings.

Question 13 [Medium]
Before you can apply to the SIA for a Public Space Surveillance (CCTV) licence, you must first:

A) Work at least 6 months as an unlicensed trainee in any CCTV control room
B) Complete a first-aid at work qualification
C) Achieve the Level 2 licence-linked qualification for CCTV operators with an approved training provider
D) Attend an SIA interview at your local police station

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: For a CCTV (Public Space Surveillance) licence you must complete the relevant Level 2 licence‑linked qualification with an SIA‑approved training provider before you apply. This is a legal requirement and covers Unit 1 (working in the private security industry), Unit 2 (working as a CCTV operator) and the practical use of CCTV systems.

Question 14 [Medium]
Which of the following is MOST likely to lead the SIA to refuse an application for a CCTV operator licence?

A) An unspent conviction for robbery and assault from two years ago
B) Having changed address twice in the last year
C) Not holding a full UK driving licence
D) Having previously worked in a non‑security job

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The SIA carries out criminal record checks and looks particularly closely at offences involving violence, dishonesty and drugs when deciding if someone is fit and proper to hold a licence. Serious recent convictions for robbery and assault are very likely to cause a refusal, whereas changes of address or past non‑security employment are not usually barriers on their own.

Question 15 [Medium]
A colleague in your CCTV control room uses their mobile phone to take a picture of a monitor showing a shoplifter and then shares it in a private WhatsApp group “for a laugh”. What is the MOST appropriate action for a professional CCTV operator?

A) Ignore it because the group is private
B) Join in and share the image with friends
C) Do nothing unless the person in the image complains
D) Challenge the behaviour and report it through your organisation’s procedures, as it risks breaching data protection, SIA standards and public trust

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: CCTV images are personal data and must be handled lawfully, fairly and for legitimate purposes. Taking photos of screens and sharing them informally is likely to breach data protection requirements, CCTV codes of practice and SIA expectations of professional conduct, and it seriously undermines public trust. The correct response is to challenge and report the misuse.

Question 16 [Medium]
Which ONE of the following checks is always carried out as part of the SIA licensing process for CCTV operators?

A) A formal physical fitness test
B) A criminal record check (for example via the DBS) to look at relevant convictions
C) A driving test of your ability to drive patrol vehicles
D) A home visit by SIA staff

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: As part of the licence application, the SIA verifies identity, right to work and carries out a criminality check using official records (such as DBS information) before deciding whether to grant or refuse a licence. There is no routine fitness test or driving test for CCTV operators.

Question 17 [Medium]
During a busy evening shift in the town‑centre control room, you realise you have left your SIA licence badge at home and cannot produce it if asked. What is the BEST action to take?

A) Carry on as normal – the licence number on the staff rota is enough
B) Hide in the back of the control room so nobody sees you
C) Inform your supervisor immediately and stop carrying out licensable duties until you can prove you hold a valid licence
D) Borrow a colleague’s licence as a temporary measure

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Front line licence holders are required to have their licence with them and display it while carrying out licensable activities. If you cannot produce your badge, the safest option is to tell your supervisor and step away from licensable duties until your licence can be shown, rather than working un‑badged or (worse) using someone else’s licence.

Question 18 [Medium]
A local authority is choosing between two security companies to run its CCTV control room. One of the companies is part of the SIA Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS). Why might the authority see this as an advantage?

A) ACS status shows the company has been independently assessed as meeting higher standards of management and service
B) ACS status means the company does not need to license its staff
C) ACS status guarantees the company is the cheapest
D) ACS status allows the company to ignore British Standards

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: ACS is a voluntary quality assurance scheme in which companies are independently assessed against recognised operational and performance standards. It is often viewed as a “quality mark” and can give buyers confidence in the professionalism and management systems of the security supplier. It does not remove the need to licence individual staff.

Question 19 [Medium]
A member of the public asks why CCTV operators have to be licensed by the SIA at all. Which reply BEST explains the main purpose of SIA regulation?

A) To raise money through licence fees
B) To protect the public by ensuring security staff are properly vetted, trained and meet agreed standards
C) To remove the need for police officers in town centres
D) To promote private security companies’ profits

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The SIA’s mission is to protect the public, reduce criminality and improve standards in the private security industry through licensing individuals and managing the ACS for companies. Licensing checks identity, criminality and qualification so that only suitable, trained people can work in sensitive roles such as public space CCTV.

Question 20 [Medium]
In a CCTV control room, you discover that a new operator is using a relative’s SIA badge because their own application has not yet been approved. Which statement is MOST accurate?

A) This is acceptable if both people have passed the training course
B) This is only a minor breach of company policy
C) This is allowed as long as their supervisor knows
D) This could amount to using a false licence and is a serious criminal matter that could lead to prosecution and loss of licensing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Using someone else’s licence misleads others into believing the wearer is the vetted and approved person named on the card. The Act creates offences around using false licences or falsely claiming status (for example ACS approval), and such conduct can lead to prosecution and the loss of any existing or future SIA licences.

Question 21 [Hard]
Sam holds a valid SIA CCTV licence and works nights in a transport hub control room. Six months into the licence period he receives a conviction for a serious assault. Worried he might lose his job, he continues working and does not inform his employer or the SIA. Which of the following BEST describes Sam’s position?

A) He is safe to continue working because his licence is still within its three‑year expiry date
B) He only needs to tell the SIA when he next renews his licence
C) He is breaching his licence conditions because he must report relevant changes such as new criminal convictions, and this could lead to his licence being reviewed or revoked
D) He can avoid problems by applying for a second licence instead

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: SIA licence conditions require holders to tell the SIA about relevant changes, including new criminal convictions. Failure to do so is a breach of licence conditions and may lead to suspension or revocation if the SIA decides he is no longer fit and proper to hold a licence. Simply waiting until renewal does not meet his obligations.

Question 22 [Hard]
Mia’s SIA CCTV licence card is lost on the way to work. She still holds a valid licence on the SIA’s system. What is the MOST appropriate first step she should take?

A) Report the loss to the SIA and apply for a replacement licence card as soon as possible
B) Borrow a colleague’s badge until the end of the week
C) Stop working permanently because she can never be issued another licence
D) Continue as normal and only mention it at her next renewal in two years

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: If a licence card is lost or stolen, the holder should inform the SIA promptly and request a replacement. A replacement card can be issued for a fee, and the licence record itself remains valid. Borrowing someone else’s card would be dishonest and could amount to using a false licence.

Question 23 [Hard]
A CCTV operator is considering two job offers: one with a small security company that is not part of the ACS, and one with a larger firm that is an SIA Approved Contractor. From the operator’s point of view, which statement is MOST accurate?

A) Working for an ACS company means he personally does not need an SIA licence
B) ACS companies are regularly audited and usually offer better training and professional standards, which can support his career development
C) ACS companies are exempt from health and safety law
D) Non‑ACS companies are not allowed to operate CCTV control rooms at all

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: ACS‑approved companies are independently assessed against a wide range of criteria, including staff training, vetting, management systems and service delivery. This often means a more professional environment and better development opportunities for staff, but individuals still need their own SIA licences.

Question 24 [Hard]
Your control room manager says the CCTV scheme is being reviewed to ensure it complies with BS 7958. What is the MAIN reason this is important for a public‑space CCTV system?

A) BS 7958 replaces the need for any SIA licensing
B) BS 7958 only deals with how many cameras a control room must have
C) BS 7958 gives recognised best‑practice recommendations for managing and operating CCTV control rooms, supporting evidence quality and protection of individuals’ rights
D) BS 7958 is a standard that only applies to static guarding patrols

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: BS 7958 is the British Standard that provides a code of practice for the management and operation of CCTV within a controlled environment, including public‑space systems. It focuses on good governance, evidential standards and respect for privacy and legal requirements. Static guarding and patrol services are instead covered by BS 7499.

Question 25 [Hard]
A contracted CCTV control room repeatedly ignores procedures, allows unlicensed staff to monitor cameras, and has several incidents where operators share images on social media. Which of the following is the MOST likely combination of consequences?

A) The police will automatically take over running the system with no further action
B) The operators might be told to attend extra training, but there are no legal or professional risks
C) Only the security company’s profits will be affected, with no impact on the wider industry
D) There could be loss of public trust, legal or regulatory action (for example under the Private Security Industry Act and data protection law), and individuals may lose their SIA licences

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Persistent poor practice can lead to loss of public confidence, regulatory enforcement by the SIA (including inspections, warnings or prosecution) and potential breaches of data protection and human rights law. Individuals involved risk suspension or revocation of their licences, and the company may face criminal or civil action.
