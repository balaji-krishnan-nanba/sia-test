BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer
- 60 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 90 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (42 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.5) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Security officers may need to conduct searches of persons, bags, and vehicles 
to prevent theft, detect prohibited items, and maintain security. However, 
searches must be conducted legally and with respect for individuals' rights. 
Understanding the legal basis for searches and proper procedures protects 
both the security officer and the organisation from legal liability.
