================================================================================
SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.5
MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND POST-INCIDENT
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 20 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 4.5 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification - Physical Intervention Unit.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

WHAT IS UNIT 4?
---------------
Unit 4 focuses on Physical Intervention Skills - the knowledge and 
understanding needed when physical intervention becomes necessary.

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 4: Physical Intervention Skills
- 30 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 45 minutes duration
- 80% pass mark (24 correct answers required)
- This chapter (4.5) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 4

KEY PRINCIPLE
-------------
Medical emergencies can and do occur during physical intervention. 
Understanding the risks - particularly positional asphyxia and excited 
delirium - and knowing how to respond can save lives. Post-incident 
procedures protect both the person restrained and the door supervisor.

CHAPTER 4.5: MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 20
- Easy (direct recall): 8 questions
- Medium (application): 8 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.5.1: POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE - PEOPLE DIE FROM THIS

What is Positional Asphyxia:
- Inability to breathe due to body position
- Position prevents adequate respiration
- Can lead to death within minutes
- Particularly in face-down (prone) position

Why It Happens:
- Body position compresses chest/abdomen
- Cannot expand lungs fully
- Breathing becomes ineffective
- Oxygen levels drop
- Person becomes unconscious and dies

Highest Risk Position:
- PRONE (face-down)
- With hands restrained behind back
- With weight on their back
- With pressure on neck/chest

Contributing Factors:

PHYSICAL FACTORS:
- Obesity (abdominal fat compresses diaphragm)
- Pregnancy
- Enlarged abdomen
- Respiratory conditions (asthma, COPD)
- Heart conditions

INTOXICATION:
- Alcohol
- Drugs
- Reduced awareness of distress
- Reduced ability to communicate distress
- Body may not respond normally

EXERTION:
- Struggle increases oxygen demand
- But position prevents meeting demand
- Exhaustion makes worse
- Adrenaline depleted

RESTRAINT:
- Position held too long
- Weight applied to back
- Neck/chest compression
- Limited movement

Warning Signs:

EARLY:
- Complaints of difficulty breathing
- "I can't breathe"
- Gasping
- Heavy panting

PROGRESSING:
- Going quiet after struggling
- Colour change (blue lips, grey skin)
- Reduced resistance
- Confusion
- Gurgling sounds

CRITICAL:
- Silence
- Limpness
- Unresponsive
- Blue/grey colour
- Not breathing

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IF CONCERNED:
- Change position IMMEDIATELY
- Recovery position or sitting
- Call 999
- Start CPR if not breathing
- Someone died - act NOW

Prevention:

NEVER:
- Keep face-down longer than absolutely necessary
- Put weight on back
- Kneel on back or chest
- Ignore complaints of breathing difficulty
- Assume they're faking

ALWAYS:
- Turn to recovery position ASAP
- Or get them seated/standing
- Monitor continuously
- Take complaints seriously
- Have observer watching for signs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.5.2: EXCITED DELIRIUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Excited Delirium (ExDS):
- Acute behavioural condition
- Associated with stimulant drugs or mental health crisis
- Characterised by extreme agitation
- Can be life-threatening

Causes:
- Stimulant drugs (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine)
- Mental health crisis
- Sometimes combination of factors
- Medical condition

Signs and Symptoms:

BEHAVIOURAL:
- Extreme agitation
- Bizarre behaviour
- Aggression/violence
- Shouting/screaming
- Incoherent speech
- Paranoia
- Superhuman strength/resistance
- Failure to respond to pain

PHYSICAL:
- Profuse sweating
- High body temperature (hyperthermia)
- Removal of clothing (too hot)
- Dilated pupils
- Rapid breathing
- Rapid heart rate

Why It's Dangerous:

MEDICAL EMERGENCY:
- Heart can fail
- Body overheats
- Organ failure
- Sudden death possible
- Even after restraint ends

RESTRAINT RISK:
- Struggle increases risk
- Restraint can trigger sudden death
- Positional asphyxia more likely
- Must be treated as medical emergency

Response:

TREAT AS MEDICAL EMERGENCY:
- Call ambulance immediately
- Don't wait for them to collapse
- Tell ambulance "suspected excited delirium"
- This is NOT just a police matter

RESTRAINT:
- If restraint necessary, use minimum
- Avoid prone position
- Monitor constantly
- Reduce restraint as soon as possible
- Cool them down if possible

AFTER RESTRAINT:
- Don't assume they're safe because calm
- Sudden death can occur after restraint ends
- Continue medical observation
- Ambulance attendance essential

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.5.3: OTHER MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heart Attack/Cardiac Event:
- Chest pain, arm pain
- Shortness of breath
- Sweating, nausea
- Can occur during/after struggle
- Call 999, prepare for CPR

Seizure:
- Person may have epilepsy
- Triggered by stress/exertion
- Protect head, don't restrain
- Recovery position after
- Call ambulance

Asthma Attack:
- Triggered by exertion/stress

UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.5: MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND POST-INCIDENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is positional asphyxia?

A) A type of breathing exercise used during restraint
B) Inability to breathe adequately due to body position
C) A technique for controlling breathing during escort
D) A medical condition that prevents physical intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Positional asphyxia is the inability to breathe adequately due 
to body position. It occurs when the position of a person's body prevents 
them from breathing properly, particularly in the face-down (prone) position 
with weight on the back. It can be fatal within minutes.
