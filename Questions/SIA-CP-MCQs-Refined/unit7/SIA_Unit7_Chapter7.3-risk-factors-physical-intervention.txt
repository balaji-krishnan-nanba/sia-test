UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.3: COMMUNICATION AND DE-ESCALATION SKILLS

Question 1 [Easy]
According to Mehrabian's research, what percentage of communication
is through body language?

A) 7%
B) 38%
C) 55%
D) 93%

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mehrabian's work on spoken communication suggests that around 55% of the emotional meaning is conveyed through body language, about 38% through tone of voice, and only about 7% through the actual words used. Important note: This research specifically examined the communication of feelings and attitudes in ambiguous contexts, not all forms of communication—these percentages should not be applied universally.

 However, for conflict situations where emotions run high, non-verbal skills remain critical in de-escalation.

Question 2 [Easy]
In the basic communication process, which element is responsible for encoding a message before it is sent?

A) The sender
B) The message
C) The receiver
D) The feedback

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The sender decides what they want to say and encodes the message into words, tone and body language before transmitting it. The receiver then decodes that message and responds, completing the communication loop.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which option BEST describes active listening during a tense interaction?

A) Waiting for the other person to stop so you can give your view
B) Giving full attention, showing you are listening, and responding appropriately
C) Asking as many questions as possible, as quickly as possible
D) Limiting eye contact and staying silent to avoid getting involved

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Active listening means focusing fully on the speaker, using appropriate eye contact, nods and brief acknowledgements, and then paraphrasing or clarifying to show you have understood. This helps the person feel heard and often reduces anger.

Question 4 [Easy]
In close protection work, what is the primary purpose of using the “fence” position?

A) To block the person’s path in an aggressive way
B) To signal secretly to colleagues to move in
C) To hide your hands so the person cannot see them
D) To create a non‑aggressive barrier while keeping a reactionary gap and being defence‑ready

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The “fence” uses raised, open hands in front of the body. It looks non‑threatening but creates space, protects personal safety and allows you to react quickly if the person attacks, making it both a de‑escalation and safety tool.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which type of aggression is generally considered more dangerous for a close protection operative?

A) Instrumental/predatory aggression
B) Reactive/emotional aggression
C) Accidental aggression
D) Crowd aggression

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Instrumental (predatory) aggression is deliberate, calm and goal‑driven—for example, planning an attack to get to the principal.

 Because it is calculated and controlled, it is usually more dangerous than impulsive, emotional outbursts.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which option BEST describes target glancing as a pre‑attack indicator?

A) Repeatedly looking at your ID badge
B) Repeatedly looking at the area they intend to strike
C) Avoiding all eye contact and looking at the floor
D) Watching only the nearest exit constantly

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Target glancing is when a person repeatedly looks at where they plan to strike—such as your chin, nose or groin. Combined with other cues, it is a strong sign that an attack may be imminent.

Question 7 [Easy]
What is the MAIN benefit of using tactical breathing (4‑4‑4‑4 box breathing) during a confrontation?

A) It increases adrenaline so you can react faster
B) It makes the other person feel more relaxed instantly
C) It helps control your stress response and regain clear thinking
D) It lowers your heart rate below resting level

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Tactical breathing, also known as box breathing, uses a 4‑phase cycle: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, then hold for 4 seconds before repeating. This helps regulate the body's stress response, reducing the impact of adrenaline so you can think more clearly and stay in control.

Question 8 [Easy]
On the radio, what does the phrase “Say again” mean?

A) I have received your message
B) I will comply with your instruction
C) I have finished talking
D) Please repeat your last message

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: “Say again” is standard radio language for “please repeat your last message”. Clear, agreed phrases reduce confusion and help teams coordinate safely and efficiently.

Question 9 [Medium]
A guest at a venue is speaking loudly about a delay but has not yet become abusive or threatening. You decide to use the five‑step appeal. What is the MOST appropriate first step?

A) Immediately warn them they will be removed if they do not stop
B) Politely ask them to lower their voice and explain the problem
C) Tell them to calm down and stop being ridiculous
D) Ignore them until they either calm down or go away

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Step 1 of the five‑step appeal is a polite request—giving the person a chance to comply voluntarily. Jumping straight to threats or ignoring the issue can quickly push the situation towards escalation instead of resolution.

Question 10 [Medium]
You approach an agitated individual who is upset about being refused entry. What is the MOST appropriate non‑verbal stance to support de‑escalation and safety?

A) Stand square‑on, very close, with arms folded across your chest
B) Move in close, chest to chest, to show you are not afraid
C) Stand side‑on with your back partly turned to appear relaxed
D) Stand at a slight angle with a bladed stance, hands raised in a relaxed "fence" at arm's length

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A bladed stance with hands in a relaxed “fence” keeps you balanced and ready, maintains a reactionary gap, and looks less confrontational than standing square‑on and close. This supports both de‑escalation and officer safety.

Question 11 [Medium]
A man in a shopping centre calmly positions himself near the principal’s route, appears to be watching security, and waits, showing no obvious emotional outburst. His behaviour looks planned and purposeful. What type of aggression does this MOST likely represent?

A) Reactive aggression
B) Accidental aggression
C) Instrumental/predatory aggression
D) Displaced aggression

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Instrumental or predatory aggression is controlled and goal‑directed.

 The person may appear calm while positioning themselves to achieve an objective, such as approaching or attacking the principal.

Question 12 [Medium]
During an argument outside a venue, a man begins squaring up, clenching his fists and glancing repeatedly at your chin. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response?

A) Increase distance, adopt a "fence" position and continue talking calmly while preparing for escalation
B) Move closer so he knows you are in charge
C) Fold your arms and maintain hard eye contact to show strength
D) Drop into a deep crouch so you are below his eye line

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: These are clear pre‑attack indicators. Increasing distance, using the fence, maintaining calm communication and preparing tactically are the safest and most professional responses, giving you more time and options.

Question 13 [Medium]
During a heated dispute, you notice your heart racing and your hands shaking. You feel angry at the insults being thrown at you. Which action is the MOST effective way to manage your own state?

A) Raise your voice so the person knows you are in control
B) Walk away without informing your team what is happening
C) Focus on how disrespectful the person is and plan what you will say back
D) Use slow, controlled 4‑4‑4‑4 tactical breathing and remind yourself to stay professional

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Tactical breathing and positive self‑talk ("stay calm, focus on the job") help manage the stress response, maintain professional detachment and support better decision‑making in a confrontation. The complete tactical breathing cycle is: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, then repeat.

Question 14 [Medium]
You need urgent assistance and call your teammate on the radio during an escalating incident. What information should you give first?

A) Your personal opinion of the person causing the problem
B) Your exact location and a brief description of the problem
C) The full background of everything that has happened that evening
D) The name of your supervisor and their contact number

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In a fast‑moving situation, your colleague needs to know where you are and what is happening so they can respond effectively. Extra detail can follow once help is on the way.

Question 15 [Medium]
You radio a colleague: "Charlie One from Alpha Two, assist required at main entrance." They reply, "Alpha Two, Wilco." What does "Wilco" mean in this context?

A) I have received your message and will comply
B) Please repeat your last message
C) I can hear you but I am busy
D) I am ending this transmission now

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: “Wilco” means “will comply”—the colleague is confirming both receipt and that they will act on your message. This avoids confusion during time‑critical incidents.

Question 16 [Medium]
Which of the following is the BEST example of positive self‑talk that supports professional detachment during a hostile encounter?

A) "This is personal. I'm not letting them speak to me like that."
B) "If they get louder, I'll just shout over them."
C) "Stay calm, focus on the job, keep it professional."
D) "I always seem to end up dealing with idiots."

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Professional detachment means not taking abuse personally. Statements like “stay calm, focus on the job” help you manage emotions and respond based on training and procedure, not pride or anger.

Question 17 [Hard]
You are in a hotel lobby with your principal. A man, clearly frustrated at being refused entry to the bar, is speaking loudly and swearing about the “stupid rules”. He is facing you but has not made direct threats or shown clear pre‑attack indicators. Which verbal response is MOST likely to support de‑escalation at this stage?

A) “I can see this is frustrating. Let’s step over here so we can talk about what we can do.”
B) “You need to calm down right now or you’ll be removed.”
C) “Whatever, it’s the bar’s rules, not my problem.”
D) “Stop shouting. If you don’t like it, just leave.”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Option A shows empathy (“I can see this is frustrating”), uses respectful language and offers a simple request and option, fitting with the early stages of the five‑step appeal. Options B–D use trigger phrases (“you need to…”, “whatever”, “calm down”) and are likely to escalate the situation.

Question 18 [Hard]
You and your principal are walking down a corridor towards an exit. An agitated male steps in front of you, complaining loudly about being removed from an event. There is limited space, but no obvious weapon. What is the MOST appropriate positioning to protect the principal and support de‑escalation?

A) Move right up to him, chest‑to‑chest, arms folded, to show confidence
B) Stand behind the principal so you do not appear threatening to the male
C) Stand side‑on with your hands in your pockets and stare directly into his eyes
D) Place yourself between him and the principal with a bladed stance, hands in a relaxed "fence" at least arm's length away

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Placing yourself between the threat and the principal while maintaining a bladed stance and fence keeps you ready, preserves a reactionary gap and still looks non‑aggressive. The other options either increase confrontation or reduce your ability to protect the principal.

Question 19 [Hard]
At a nightclub entrance, a customer who was earlier complaining has now punched another person and is struggling violently with door staff. He is shouting incoherently and not responding to instructions. In terms of the conflict cycle, which stage does this MOST closely represent?

A) Trigger
B) Crisis
C) Escalation
D) Post‑crisis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The crisis stage is the peak of the conflict cycle, when behaviour is most dangerous and rational thinking is greatly reduced.

 This is not the ideal time to start de‑escalation; safer options may involve containment and safety‑focused physical intervention if absolutely necessary.

Question 20 [Hard]
You are dealing with a male who is upset about being refused entry. His face has gone pale, he has taken a half‑step closer, removed his watch and is clenching his fists. He keeps glancing at your chin. What is the MOST appropriate tactical response?

A) Move closer and point your finger at his face to show authority
B) Immediately punch him to "get in first" before he can move
C) Increase distance while adopting a fence position, call for backup and make a final attempt at calm communication
D) Turn your back and walk away quickly to end the conversation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The behaviour described shows multiple pre‑attack indicators—removing jewellery, clenching fists, target glancing and invading personal space. The professional response is to increase distance, adopt a fence, call for assistance and continue a final de‑escalation attempt, only considering pre‑emptive action if an attack is clearly imminent and you honestly believe it is necessary and proportionate.
