Understanding How Attackers Plan:

The Hostile Planning Cycle (Attack Cycle):

1. TARGET SELECTION:
   - Choosing the target
   - Based on value/profile
   - Accessibility assessment
   - Symbolic value
   - Vulnerability assessment

2. SURVEILLANCE/RECONNAISSANCE:
   - Information gathering

   - Routine identification
   - Security assessment
   - Entry/exit points

3. PLANNING:
   - Method selection
   - Resource acquisition
   - Team organisation
   - Timing decisions
   - Contingency planning

4. DEPLOYMENT:
   - Moving into position
   - Final reconnaissance
   - Equipment preparation
   - Communication check
   - Point of no return

5. ATTACK:
   - Execution of plan
   - Achieving objectives

TOPIC 1.4.4: RISK ASSESSMENT FUNDAMENTALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Risk:
- Likelihood of threat materialising
- Combined with potential impact
- Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

Key Definitions:

THREAT:

- Who or what could cause damage
- Capability and intent

VULNERABILITY:
- Weakness that can be exploited
- Gap in protection
- Opportunity for attack

IMPACT:
- Consequence if attack succeeds
- Severity of outcome
- Effect on principal

LIKELIHOOD:
- Probability of occurrence
- How likely is attack
- Based on intelligence

Risk Matrix:

             |  LOW Impact  | MEDIUM Impact | HIGH Impact
-------------+--------------+---------------+-------------
HIGH         |   MEDIUM     |     HIGH      |  CRITICAL
Likelihood   |              |               |
-------------+--------------+---------------+-------------
MEDIUM       |    LOW       |    MEDIUM     |    HIGH
Likelihood   |              |               |
-------------+--------------+---------------+-------------

5. EVALUATE RISK:
   - Combine factors
   - Use risk matrix
   - Prioritise risks

6. IMPLEMENT COUNTERMEASURES:
   - Reduce likelihood
   - Reduce impact
   - Mitigate vulnerabilities

7. REVIEW:
   - Ongoing process
   - Update as needed

UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.4: THREAT ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the SECOND stage of the Hostile Planning Cycle?

A) Target Selection
B) Surveillance/Reconnaissance
C) Planning
D) Attack

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Hostile Planning Cycle follows six stages: (1) Target 
Selection, (2) Surveillance/Reconnaissance, (3) Planning, (4) Deployment, 
(5) Attack, (6) Escape. Understanding this cycle allows CPOs to identify 
and disrupt attacks at the earliest possible stage.

KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

HOSTILE PLANNING CYCLE (6 STAGES):
1. Target Selection
2. Surveillance/Reconnaissance
3. Planning
4. Deployment
5. Attack
6. Escape

UK THREAT LEVELS (highest to lowest):
1. CRITICAL - attack expected imminently
2. SEVERE - attack highly likely
3. SUBSTANTIAL - attack is likely
4. MODERATE - attack possible but not likely
5. LOW - attack unlikely

RISK FORMULA:
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS:
1. Identify threats
2. Identify vulnerabilities
3. Assess likelihood
4. Assess impact
5. Evaluate risk
6. Implement countermeasures
7. Review

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
- Avoidance (don't do it)
- Reduction (implement countermeasures)
- Transfer (insurance, contracts)
- Acceptance (accept residual risk)

VULNERABILITY FACTORS:
- Profile (public recognition)
- Predictability (routines)
- Access (public accessibility)
- Exposure (time in public)

DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Observe → Assess → Decide → Act → Review

THREAT TYPES:
- Directed (targeted at principal)
- Opportunistic (random)
- Incidental (caught up in wider event)

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- Planning is first stage (wrong - target selection)
- CRITICAL means attack has happened (wrong - expected imminently)
- Risk assessment is one-time (wrong - ongoing process)
- All risk can be eliminated (wrong - residual risk always exists)
- MODERATE is middle level (wrong - SUBSTANTIAL is middle)

================================================================================
CLOSE PROTECTION SCENARIOS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

Use these scenario types in questions:

- "During the hostile planning cycle, attackers are most vulnerable at..."
- "The UK threat level has been raised to SEVERE. This means..."
- "A CPO notices the same person in different locations over several days..."
- "When conducting a risk assessment for a new client..."
- "The principal insists on taking the same route daily. This increases..."
- "A dynamic risk assessment should be conducted when..."
- "Intelligence suggests an obsessed individual has been researching the 
   principal. At what stage of the hostile planning cycle is this person?"
