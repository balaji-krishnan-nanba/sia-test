UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.2: DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR CPOs
Question 1 [Easy]

Which description best matches the interview stance for a CPO when dealing with a potentially aggressive person?

A) Standing square‑on to the threat with feet wider than shoulder‑width, weight on the front foot and fists clenched at chest height
B) Body bladed at roughly 45 degrees to the threat, feet shoulder‑width apart, weight mainly on the back foot and knees slightly bent, with hands visible
C) Feet together, knees locked, leaning slightly backwards with arms folded across the chest
D) Side‑on with your back mostly turned to the threat, hands hanging down by your sides

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The interview stance is a bladed stance at about 45° to the threat, with feet shoulder‑width apart, weight mainly on the back foot and knees slightly bent. Hands should be visible and ready above the waist. This reduces the target area, aids balance and allows rapid defensive or protective movement without appearing overtly aggressive.

Question 2 [Easy]

In a heated verbal exchange, a CPO raises both hands with palms out between themselves and the hostile, speaking calmly. What is the main purpose of this “fence” position?

A) To warn the hostile that a strike is about to be delivered
B) To hide the hands from view so the hostile cannot see what the CPO might do
C) To create a non‑aggressive physical and psychological barrier while keeping the hands in a ready defensive position
D) To make the CPO look larger and more intimidating

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The “fence” is a non‑aggressive, palms‑out hand position that creates a physical and psychological barrier between the CPO and the threat. It helps de‑escalate, manages distance and keeps the hands in an ideal position to block, push or move if the situation suddenly turns physical.

Question 3 [Medium]

While walking a principal through a lobby, you spot an agitated man quickly approaching from the front. What is the most appropriate initial positioning for you as the CPO?

A) Move between the man and the principal, adopt a bladed stance facing the threat, keeping one hand lightly on or near the principal to guide them
B) Step directly behind the principal so that you are hidden from the threat while observing
C) Stand shoulder‑to‑shoulder with the principal, both of you facing square‑on towards the man
D) Move several metres away from the principal to draw the man's attention, leaving the principal stationary

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The CPO should position themselves between the threat and the principal, bladed towards the threat for balance and a smaller target, while maintaining contact and communication with the principal. This creates a shield, keeps evacuation options open and allows rapid defensive action.

Question 4 [Easy]

Which type of block is primarily used to defend against an overhead attack aimed at the head?

A) Low block
B) Outside block
C) Inside/middle block
D) High block, with the forearm raised above the head

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
A high block uses the forearm raised above the head to intercept or deflect downward or overhead strikes aimed at the head or face. Low and middle blocks protect lower parts of the body, not primarily the head from overhead blows.

Question 5 [Easy]

What is the key principle behind deflecting an attack rather than trying to stop it dead with force?

A) Redirecting the attacker's force using angles and minimal effort
B) Proving to the attacker that your strength is greater than theirs
C) Ensuring the attacker is knocked to the floor with each contact
D) Absorbing the full impact to show confidence and control

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Deflection aims to guide the attack off its line using angles and timing, not brute strength. By redirecting momentum rather than meeting force with force, the CPO uses less energy, reduces impact and often creates openings to move, protect the principal or disengage.

Question 6 [Medium]

During a walk‑through at a venue, a man suddenly steps in and swings a punch towards your principal’s head. What is the most appropriate immediate action as the CPO?

A) Step backwards with the principal and shout for security without engaging the attacker's arm
B) Step in between the attacker and the principal, use an appropriate block on the attacking arm and drive the principal away from the attacker
C) Attempt to catch the punch and apply a wrist lock on the attacker while the principal remains where they are
D) Push the principal towards the attacker to unbalance him, then counter‑strike

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The CPO’s priority is to protect the principal. Stepping between threat and principal, blocking the attack and immediately moving the principal away applies key principles: shielding, blocking for protection and creating distance for evacuation. Complex joint locks or ignoring the attack put the principal at risk.

Question 7 [Easy]

In defensive tactics, which of the following best describes a parry?

A) Crossing both forearms in front of the face to form a solid cover against strikes
B) Dropping to one knee to avoid a punch
C) Lightly guiding an incoming strike past your body with a quick, minimal contact movement
D) Catching the attacker's hand and twisting the wrist

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
A parry is a light, efficient deflection using minimal contact to guide an attack offline. It relies on timing and small movements rather than strength, allowing quick recovery for follow‑up actions or movement.

Question 8 [Medium]

You are dealing with a hostile individual at very close range when they explosively launch a flurry of fast punches at your head. There is little time to read each strike. What is the safest immediate response?

A) Try to slip every individual punch by moving your head from side to side
B) Duck low and stay in a crouched position until the punches stop
C) Step straight backwards without using your hands so you do not escalate the situation
D) Adopt a tight cover block protecting your head and neck while moving to create space

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
When overwhelmed by rapid strikes, a cover block (arms tight around the head, elbows in, chin down) protects vital areas and buys time. Combining cover with movement to create distance follows the principle of survival first, then repositioning for escape or further defence.

Question 9 [Medium]

A man rushes straight towards you and your principal, reaching out to grab. Which footwork option best supports your defensive response and protection of the principal?

A) Step off the line of attack to the side and pivot to face the man from a new angle
B) Remain rooted in place in a strong stance so you cannot be moved
C) Back straight away in a straight line until you reach a wall
D) Turn your back on the man and run past the principal

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Stepping off‑line and pivoting takes you and the principal off the direct line of attack, makes the grab more difficult and often gives you a better angle for defence or evacuation. Standing still or backing straight into obstacles reduces options and increases risk.

Question 10 [Easy]

In close protection work, the “reactionary gap” refers to:

A) The delay between calling for assistance and support arriving
B) The distance from the principal to the nearest cover
C) The minimum space you maintain from a potential threat to give yourself time to perceive and react
D) The time a court allows for you to justify your actions after an incident

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The reactionary gap is the minimum safe distance between you and a potential threat, usually at least arm’s length and more if weapons are suspected. This space gives you time to see, decide and move before an assault can land.

Question 11 [Medium]

You are escorting a principal through a restaurant when a potentially violent individual starts to move quickly towards you. Which tactic best uses the environment to help you create and maintain distance?

A) Stand your ground in the middle of an open walkway to show authority
B) Move the principal towards the aggressor so you can reach him faster
C) Guide the principal into a corner so they cannot be pushed further
D) Use footwork to angle away and place tables and chairs between your team and the aggressor while moving towards an exit

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Using environmental barriers such as tables, chairs or counters between you and the aggressor increases their difficulty in reaching you and the principal. Combining this with movement towards an exit applies key principles of distance, barriers and evacuation.

Question 12 [Medium]

On a team detail in a crowded bar, what is the most effective way for CPOs to manage distance around the principal?

A) Each CPO stands as close as possible to the principal, shoulder‑to‑shoulder, regardless of the crowd
B) The team forms a flexible perimeter around the principal, communicating as people close in and adjusting positions to maintain a reactionary gap
C) Team members spread randomly through the crowd to observe from a distance
D) One CPO walks with the principal while the rest stay outside the venue

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
A flexible protective formation around the principal allows the team to monitor all directions, adjust to crowd movement and maintain a reactionary gap. This supports communication, early identification of threats and coordinated evacuation if needed.

Question 13 [Easy]

An assailant seizes your wrist to prevent you moving your arm. According to good release principles, what should you do first?

A) Pull directly against the strongest part of their grip as hard as possible
B) Rotate or pull your wrist explosively against the attacker's thumb, then move away
C) Move closer to the attacker so they are forced to let go
D) Drop to the floor to try to slip out of the grip

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The thumb is the weakest part of a grip. Rotating or pulling your wrist against the thumb, with a quick, committed motion, exploits this weakness. After release, you should immediately create distance and reposition to protect yourself and the principal.

Question 14 [Medium]

You are grabbed in a tight front bear hug with your arms pinned. What is the most effective initial response?

A) Immediately try to reach over the attacker's shoulders to apply a headlock
B) Lean backwards and lift your feet off the ground to make it harder to move you
C) Lower your base by dropping your weight, create space with your hips, then use strikes if necessary to force a release and escape
D) Relax and wait for the attacker to tire before attempting to escape

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Dropping your weight widens your base and makes you harder to move, while driving your hips back creates space to breathe and strike. From there, appropriate strikes and movement can break the hold and allow you to escape or reposition.

Question 15 [Hard]

You are standing between your principal and an aggressive individual in a corridor. The aggressor suddenly grabs you around the throat with both hands, trying to choke you, while the principal is immediately behind you. What is the most appropriate sequence of actions?

A) Ignore the choke and push the principal backwards while enduring the pressure until help arrives
B) Attempt a high, spinning kick to the attacker's head to knock them away from the principal
C) Turn your back on the attacker to face the principal and ask if they are all right
D) Protect your airway by tucking your chin, explosively pluck/strip the hands from your throat, use necessary strikes, then create distance and move the principal away

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
A choke is life‑threatening and must be dealt with immediately. Tucking the chin and plucking/stripping the hands off the throat protects the airway. Once breathing is protected, strikes and movement create space. Only then can you effectively evacuate the principal.

Question 16 [Easy]

Why is the palm strike often preferred over a closed‑fist punch for defensive striking by a CPO?

A) It is less likely to injure the CPO's hand while still being effective to targets such as the face, chin or nose
B) It always knocks an attacker unconscious with a single strike
C) It is considered non‑violent and therefore never scrutinised legally
D) It can only be used at long range, keeping the CPO safely away

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Using the heel of the palm reduces the risk of damaging small hand bones on hard targets like the skull, while still delivering effective force to appropriate areas. This aligns with professional practice and risk management for the CPO.

Question 17 [Medium]

Which of the following target areas is generally MOST appropriate for a proportionate defensive strike intended to quickly stop an attack without creating unnecessary risk of serious injury?

A) Throat
B) Back of the head
C) Solar plexus
D) Spine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The solar plexus is a sensitive area that can temporarily wind and disable an attacker without the same high risk of catastrophic injury as the throat, spine or back of the head. CPOs must use necessary and proportionate force, avoiding high‑risk targets unless facing a life‑threatening situation.

Question 18 [Medium]

A man seizes the front of your jacket with one hand and aggressively pulls you towards him while you are shielding the principal behind you. You cannot immediately break his grip. What is the most effective way to create an opportunity to escape with the principal?

A) Deliver a close‑range knee strike to the attacker's thigh or body while controlling the gripping hand, then drive him away to create distance
B) Apply a slow, painful finger lock to teach him a lesson before releasing
C) Release the principal and focus on wrestling the attacker to the ground
D) Wait passively until the attacker pulls you closer, then attempt a head‑butt

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
A close‑range knee strike is powerful at short distance and can disrupt the attacker enough to loosen or weaken the grip. Controlling the gripping hand prevents further attacks while you create space and move the principal away. The goal is to create distance and evacuate, not punish.

Question 19 [Easy]

When facing a person armed with a knife while you are unarmed and with your principal, what should be your FIRST priority?

A) Attempt to grab the blade so it cannot be used
B) Create maximum distance and escape with the principal, using barriers and cover if possible
C) Engage the attacker in a prolonged fight to disarm them
D) Move towards the attacker so they cannot gain momentum

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Edged‑weapon attacks are extremely dangerous and even “successful” defences may result in injury. The priority is survival and protection of the principal: maximise distance, use barriers and escape. Direct engagement is a last resort when escape is impossible.

Question 20 [Hard]

You are escorting a principal towards a parked vehicle when an aggressor appears with a metal bar, shouting and advancing rapidly from the side. There is space around the vehicle and no immediate obstacles. What is the BEST tactical option?

A) Rush straight at the aggressor to block the bar with your bare forearms
B) Stand still between the aggressor and the principal, relying only on hand blocks
C) Push the principal into the open space away from the vehicle and circle the aggressor to look for an opportunity to disarm him
D) Move the principal to the far side of the vehicle, using the vehicle as a barrier while increasing distance and seeking further escape or cover

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Impact weapons extend the attacker’s range and are very powerful. Using the vehicle as a barrier and increasing distance reduces the attacker’s ability to reach you and the principal. This applies core principles of distance, barriers and evacuation rather than attempting risky disarms.

Question 21 [Hard]

You and your principal are walking in an open car park when gunfire suddenly erupts from an unknown direction nearby. What is the MOST appropriate immediate protective action?

A) Tackle or drive the principal down below the line of fire, using your body as a shield and move them towards available cover
B) Stand upright in front of the principal with arms out to show you are in control
C) Leave the principal where they are and run towards the sound of gunfire to identify the shooter
D) Remain standing but spin around to try to locate the source of the shots before moving

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Gunfire in the open demands immediate action to get below the line of fire and to cover. Using your body as a shield (body shield) while driving the principal down and moving them towards cover is consistent with protective doctrine in an imminent lethal threat.

Question 22 [Hard]

Inside a shopping centre, you and your principal hear what you believe to be gunshots from a nearby area. People start to run in different directions. What is the BEST immediate tactical and communication response as the CPO?

A) Move towards the noise with the principal to gather more information while telling them to stay calm
B) Give clear, simple commands such as “This way” or “Get down”, move the principal away from the sound towards cover or an exit, and follow Run‑Hide‑Tell principles
C) Hide alone in a nearby shop and tell the principal to follow the crowd
D) Stand still in the open and phone the police while the principal decides where to go

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
In a suspected firearms incident, you should prioritise moving the principal away from danger towards safety using simple, clear commands. Run‑Hide‑Tell principles (escape if possible, otherwise hide, and inform authorities when safe) apply, with the CPO actively guiding the principal rather than leaving them to decide alone.
