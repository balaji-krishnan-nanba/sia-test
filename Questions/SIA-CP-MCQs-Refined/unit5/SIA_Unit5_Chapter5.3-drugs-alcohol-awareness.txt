UNIT 5, CHAPTER 5.3: SEARCHING AND ACCESS CONTROL

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the PRIMARY legal basis for a door supervisor to search a patron at a private venue?
A) The conditions of the venue’s alcohol licence
B) The door supervisor’s SIA licence
C) The person’s informed consent to be searched
D) The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Door supervisors have no special legal search powers beyond those of any other citizen. Most routine searches at venues are based on the patron’s consent, usually given as a condition of entry. If consent is refused, entry can be denied, but a search cannot be forced. Working The Doors+2Stonewall Security Ltd+2

Question 2 [Easy]
A customer at a nightclub refuses to be searched at the entrance. What is the MOST appropriate action for the door supervisor?
A) Refuse them entry to the premises
B) Detain them until the police arrive
C) Forcibly search them because they are on private property
D) Allow them in but keep a close eye on them
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Searching is voluntary and based on consent. If a patron refuses a search required by the conditions of entry, the correct response is simply to refuse entry. Door supervisors cannot forcibly search or unlawfully detain the person. Working The Doors+1

Question 3 [Easy]
Under UK law, what specific search powers does an SIA‑licensed door supervisor have?
A) The same statutory search powers as a police constable under PACE
B) Only the same powers as any other member of the public
C) Wider search powers than police while working on licensed premises
D) Powers to carry out strip searches when drugs are suspected
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
An SIA licence does not grant extra statutory search powers. Door supervisors have only the same legal powers as any other citizen and must rely on consent and conditions of entry, not police-style powers under PACE. Working The Doors+1

Question 4 [Easy]
Which description BEST matches a Level 1 search at a venue entrance?
A) A detailed search involving removal of outer clothing and footwear
B) A pat‑down of outer clothing by a same‑sex searcher
C) A search using a handheld metal‑detection wand
D) A visual inspection of the person and their open bag with no physical contact
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Level 1 is the least intrusive search. It normally involves visual checks only: observing the person, asking for bags to be opened, and looking inside without physical contact.

Question 5 [Easy]
When conducting a routine pat‑down search of a patron, what is the normal professional requirement regarding who carries out the search?
A) It should be carried out by a door supervisor of the same sex as the person being searched
B) Any supervisor can search anyone, provided they wear gloves
C) Only a manager may carry out pat‑down searches
D) The police must always be present for pat‑downs
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Pat‑down searches should be carried out by a same‑sex searcher wherever possible, to protect dignity and maintain professional standards. This is considered good practice across the private security industry. Working The Doors+1

Question 6 [Easy]
Which type of search is NOT appropriate for a door supervisor to perform?
A) A visual inspection of a customer’s bag
B) A strip search involving removal of underwear
C) A pat‑down of outer clothing with consent
D) Asking a customer to empty their own pockets
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Strip searches and any searches involving removal of underwear or examination of body cavities are beyond the role of door supervisors and should only be carried out by the police under lawful authority. Door supervisors are limited to consent‑based external and property searches.

Question 7 [Easy]
Under the Equality Act 2010, which of the following would NOT be a legitimate reason to refuse someone entry to a venue?
A) They appear severely intoxicated
B) They are clearly under the minimum age for the venue
C) They are currently banned due to previous violence
D) Their race or ethnic background
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate on protected characteristics such as race. Refusing entry because of race or ethnicity is unlawful discrimination, whereas factors like intoxication, age (in licensed premises), and previous violence are legitimate grounds when applied consistently. Equality and Human Rights Commission+1

Question 8 [Easy]
What is the MAIN reason for using barriers and an organised queue outside a busy venue?
A) To maintain safety and an orderly entry for customers
B) To make the venue look more exclusive
C) To slow down entry so staff have less work inside
D) To ensure only people on the guest list can approach the door
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Queue systems and barriers help control access, reduce pushing and queue‑jumping, protect customer safety, and support orderly entry. Appearance or exclusivity are secondary at best.

Question 9 [Medium]
At a concert, a man in a heavy coat refuses a bag search and appears very anxious. You explain the conditions of entry again, but he still will not agree to be searched. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Forcibly search him because you suspect he is hiding something
B) Refuse him entry and consider informing the police if you have serious concerns
C) Allow him in because he has paid for his ticket
D) Physically escort him to a back room and hold him there until police arrive
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
You cannot force a search or unlawfully detain him. You are entitled to refuse entry when he will not accept the search conditions, and if you genuinely suspect a serious risk (e.g. a weapon), it is appropriate to inform the police. Working The Doors+1

Question 10 [Medium]
When carrying out a pat‑down search of outer clothing, which approach is MOST appropriate?
A) Quickly pat the pockets only; any further searching is intrusive
B) Search in a different random order each time so people do not know what to expect
C) Use a systematic top‑to‑bottom (or bottom‑to‑top) method, covering all areas in a professional manner
D) Start by placing both hands firmly on the person’s chest to show control
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Pat‑down searches should be systematic and consistent, usually working from top to bottom (or vice versa). This ensures all areas of outer clothing are checked while maintaining professionalism and minimising unnecessary contact.

Question 11 [Medium]
During a bag search, which technique BEST balances security with respect for the customer’s property?
A) Empty the bag completely onto a table and inspect every item yourself
B) Insert your hands into the bag and feel around thoroughly, regardless of contents
C) Refuse to search bags because this would breach privacy laws
D) Ask the customer to open the bag and, when necessary, to move items so you can see into all compartments
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The preferred technique is to have the customer open the bag and move items where required, so you can inspect visually into all compartments. This maintains safety, reduces the risk of needle‑sticks/cuts, and shows respect for their belongings. Envisage Security Staff+1

Question 12 [Medium]
You find a small bag of white powder in a customer’s jacket during a consent search. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Seize the substance, place it in a suitable container, record the details and arrange to hand it to the police in line with venue policy
B) Put the bag back where you found it so the person can be dealt with inside if they cause problems
C) Flush the substance down the toilet so it cannot be used
D) Keep the substance in your locker until you finish your shift, then dispose of it
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Controlled drugs are regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. If you find suspected drugs, you may seize them to prevent an offence, but they must be secured, documented and handed to the police as soon as practicable, not used, destroyed or kept personally. Legislation.gov.uk+2Legislation.gov.uk+2

Question 13 [Medium]
A woman arrives at a nightclub using a wheelchair and accompanied by an assistance dog. The club usually operates a “no animals” policy. What is the BEST response from the door supervisor?
A) Refuse entry because animals are not allowed in the venue
B) Allow entry, making reasonable adjustments for her disability and permitting the assistance dog
C) Only allow entry if a friend agrees to take the dog home
D) Ask her to provide proof of disability before considering entry
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Under the Equality Act 2010, venues must not discriminate against disabled people and must make reasonable adjustments, which include permitting assistance dogs despite a general “no animals” rule. Policies cannot be applied in a way that disadvantages someone because of disability. GOV.UK+1

Question 14 [Medium]
The venue has reached its licensed capacity, but there is still a long queue outside and people are getting impatient. What is the MOST appropriate approach?
A) Allow a small extra number in to reduce the queue and avoid complaints
B) Close the doors completely and ignore the queue until people drift away
C) Operate a clear “one out, one in” system and regularly update the queue about the delay
D) Ask people at the back of the queue to leave so the queue looks shorter
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
You must not exceed the venue’s safe capacity. The correct response is to operate “one out, one in” and communicate clearly with the queue. This manages expectations, maintains safety and keeps good customer relations.

Question 15 [Medium]
After you politely refuse entry to an intoxicated customer, he becomes verbally aggressive and starts shouting at you in front of the queue. What should you do FIRST?
A) Shout back to show you are in control
B) Immediately use physical force to remove him from the area
C) Ignore him completely and hope he goes away
D) Stay calm, use de‑escalation skills, create some distance and request support from colleagues if needed
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The priority is to keep everyone safe and avoid escalation. Calm communication, creating space, and calling for support help de‑escalate the situation. Force should only be used as a last resort and must be reasonable and necessary. GOV.UK+1

Question 16 [Medium]
Inside a venue, you notice the crowd becoming very dense near an emergency exit, with people struggling to move. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?
A) Work with colleagues to relieve the pressure by directing people away and keeping the exit route clear
B) Lock the exit so people stop trying to use it
C) Turn the music up so the crowd does not notice the problem
D) Wait until someone complains before intervening
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
High crowd density near exits is a serious safety risk. You must intervene early by redirecting people, relieving pressure, and ensuring emergency exits and routes remain clear for safe movement and possible evacuation.

Question 17 [Hard]
You are providing close protection at a family event in a private venue where bags and pat‑down searches are carried out at the entrance. A 14‑year‑old boy with a backpack matches information about someone who may bring fireworks. His mother is present and has already been searched. What is the MOST appropriate way to proceed?
A) Carry out a full pat‑down search of the boy yourself, regardless of sex, due to the potential risk
B) Explain the situation, obtain the mother’s consent, ensure a same‑sex colleague searches the boy with a witness present, focusing on the backpack and outer clothing
C) Refuse the boy entry without explanation because he is under 16
D) Detain the boy and mother until police arrive, without explaining why
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Searching children requires extra care. You should explain the reason, obtain the parent’s consent, use a same‑sex searcher, have a witness present, and limit the search to outer clothing and belongings. If clear evidence of crime appears, the police can then be involved, but routine searches should still respect consent and dignity.

Question 18 [Hard]
During a pat‑down search at a music festival, your colleague feels what seems to be a knife concealed in a man’s waistband. The area is very busy and noisy. What is the MOST appropriate sequence of actions?
A) Immediately grab the knife yourself and wave it in the air to show other staff what you have found
B) Ignore it for now and allow the man into the venue to avoid causing panic
C) Calmly control the man’s movements, prevent access to the weapon, move him to a safer area if possible, and arrange for the police to attend while preserving evidence
D) Ask the man to remove the knife and place it on a nearby table so you can examine it
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Your priority is safety: control the person, not the weapon, move to a safer area if you can, and call the police. Avoid handling the weapon if possible, and preserve the scene and evidence. Many search policies advise securing the area and contacting police immediately when a weapon is found. Birmingham CMIS+1

Question 19 [Hard]
You recognise a man in the queue from a local Pubwatch banned list due to previous serious violence. When you refuse him entry, he insists you are discriminating against him because of his religion and threatens to complain. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Allow him in this time to avoid a discrimination complaint
B) Refuse entry to everyone in his group so they cannot support his complaint
C) Change your explanation and tell him the venue is “full” even though it is not
D) Politely but firmly maintain the ban based on his past behaviour, explain this clearly, and record the refusal in line with venue policy
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Refusing entry based on documented past violent behaviour and a Pubwatch ban is a legitimate, non‑discriminatory reason. You should clearly explain that your decision is about behaviour, not religion, remain professional, and document the refusal in case of later complaint. Equality and Human Rights Commission+1

Question 20 [Hard]
At a large event with a clearly advertised drug amnesty box, a man quietly drops several small wrapped packages into the box. You suspect they may be controlled drugs. What is the MOST appropriate way to deal with this?
A) Open the packages immediately and examine the contents with your bare hands to confirm what they are
B) Tip the contents of the amnesty box into a general rubbish bag at the end of the night
C) Leave the items in the sealed amnesty box, ensure they are securely stored, accurately record the circumstances and arrange for them to be collected by the police in line with policy
D) Return the items to the man and ask him to leave the site
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Amnesty schemes are designed for safe surrender. Suspected drugs should be left secured, handled as little as possible, properly recorded and ultimately handed to the police, not examined unnecessarily, thrown away or returned to the person. This supports both safety and evidential integrity. NTIA Night-Time Industry+1
