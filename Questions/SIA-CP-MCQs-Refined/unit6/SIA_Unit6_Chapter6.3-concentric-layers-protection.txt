UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.3: PROTECTIVE ESCORT AND EVACUATION TECHNIQUES

Question 1 [Easy]
In a "Contact Front" drill, which direction should the principal be
evacuated?

A) Forward, through the threat
B) To the left
C) To the rear
D) Principal stays in place

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In a "Contact Front" drill, the threat is from the front,
so the principal should be evacuated to the REAR – away from the threat.
The principle is always to move the principal in the opposite direction
to the contact. Contact Front = Evacuate Rear; Contact Rear = Evacuate
Forward; Contact Left = Evacuate Right; Contact Right = Evacuate Left.

Question 2 [Easy]
During a normal protective escort in a low‑threat environment, what is the MOST important principle to maintain?

A) Continuous protection of the principal
B) Maximum speed at all times
C) Zero physical contact at all times
D) Staying as far away from the principal as possible

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Whatever the threat level, the core principle is continuous protection – the principal should always be covered by the CPO. In a normal escort you may use light guidance and professional distance, but protection must never be broken just to look relaxed or move faster.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which escort grip provides the MAXIMUM level of control and is generally reserved for emergency situations?

A) Light guide on the back or shoulder
B) Elbow escort
C) Arm escort
D) Wrist escort

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The wrist escort involves taking hold of the principal’s wrist, giving the CPO maximum control over direction and speed. It is a strong, decisive grip, normally reserved for emergencies where rapid movement and firm control are required.

Question 4 [Easy]
During a normal, low‑threat escort with a single CPO, where should the operative position themselves in relation to the principal?

A) Directly behind the principal at arm’s length
B) Alongside the principal on the threat side
C) Several metres in front of the principal
D) Directly in front of the principal with a two‑handed grip

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In a normal escort, the CPO will usually walk alongside the principal on the most likely threat side, maintaining professional distance but ready to intervene. This positioning combines discretion with the ability to shield or guide quickly if required.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which of the following lists the stages of an emergency evacuation in the correct order?

A) Move → Decision → Alert → Protect → Secure
B) Alert → Decision → Move → Protect → Secure
C) Decision → Alert → Move → Protect → Secure
D) Alert → Move → Protect → Secure → Decision

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The emergency evacuation process follows a logical sequence:

Decision (recognise need), 2) Alert (team and principal),

Move (fastest safe route), 4) Protect (maintain cover),

Secure (reach and secure a safe location).

Question 6 [Easy]
What is the PRIMARY purpose of using a wedge formation during a crowd evacuation?

A) To create a path through the crowd for the principal
B) To hide the principal completely within the team
C) To split the team into separate pairs
D) To slow the team’s progress and avoid contact with others

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The wedge formation forms a V‑shape with a point person at the front. Its main purpose is to drive a path through a dense crowd, allowing the principal to move forward while the team physically and verbally clears space.

Question 7 [Easy]
When moving UP a staircase with a three‑person team, what is the preferred order from front to back?

A) Principal → Point CPO → Rear CPO
B) Point CPO → Principal → Rear CPO
C) Point CPO → Rear CPO → Principal
D) Rear CPO → Principal → Point CPO

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When ascending, the point CPO leads to check ahead and manage ambush risks, the principal follows in the middle, and rear security protects from behind. This keeps the principal sandwiched between protection while moving through a vulnerable area.

Question 8 [Easy]
When using a vehicle for cover from gunfire, which part offers the BEST protection for the principal?

A) The roof panel
B) The door panel
C) The windscreens
D) The engine block

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The engine block is the most effective ballistic cover on a standard vehicle and can stop or slow rounds. Doors and panels mostly provide concealment, as many bullets can penetrate them. Tyres and wheels offer some low‑level protection, but the engine block is preferred whenever possible.

Question 9 [Easy]
During an evacuation, the principal becomes frozen with fear and stops moving in the middle of a corridor. What should the CPO do FIRST?

A) Leave the principal and deal with the threat alone
B) Firmly tell the principal they will be debriefed later
C) Use a calm but firm voice with simple commands and start physically guiding them
D) Shout at the principal and pull them sharply to get them moving

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A frozen principal is a common panic response. The CPO should use a calm but authoritative tone, give simple, direct commands (e.g. “Move with me now”), and combine this with reassuring but purposeful physical guidance. This breaks the panic cycle without unnecessary aggression.

Question 10 [Medium]
In an emergency escort where a genuine threat has been identified, how should a CPO balance speed and security?

A) Move as fast as is safely possible while maintaining continuous protection and coordination
B) Run as fast as possible, even if the team and formation break up
C) Move slowly to keep a perfect escort formation, regardless of the threat
D) Stop to give the principal a full explanation before moving

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In an emergency, speed becomes a priority, but not at the expense of protection. The team must move quickly and maintain a protective bubble, communication, and awareness. Blind speed that destroys formation or leaves gaps can increase risk rather than reduce it.

Question 11 [Medium]
A two‑person close protection team is escorting a principal when shots are fired from ahead (“Contact Front!”). According to team evacuation drills, what is the MOST appropriate initial division of roles?

A) Both CPOs remain directly beside the principal and do not engage the threat
B) The nearest CPO evacuates while the other continues walking the principal forward
C) Both CPOs rush towards the threat to neutralise it before moving the principal
D) One CPO engages or delays the threat while the other evacuates the principal in the correct direction

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In a two‑person team, contact drills require one CPO to engage/delay the threat to create time and space, while the other evacuates the principal in the appropriate direction (opposite to the contact). This division protects the principal without leaving the threat unchecked.

Question 12 [Medium]
You are moving the principal along a pavement when gunfire erupts from your left side. The team leader shouts “Contact Left!”. In line with standard contact drills, what evacuation command should follow?

A) “Evacuate left!”
B) “Evacuate right!”
C) “Evacuate forward!”
D) “Evacuate rear!”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: With a threat from the left, the team should evacuate to the right, away from the contact. The rule is always to move the principal in the opposite direction to the threat: Contact Left → Evacuate Right.

Question 13 [Medium]
You are evacuating a principal from a concert when a panicking crowd starts surging towards the main exit. You need to move the principal towards a side exit that is against the direction of crowd movement. What is the MOST appropriate strategy?

A) Forcefully push directly against the crowd flow to reach the side exit immediately
B) Leave the principal in a “safe corner” while the team clears a path
C) Move with the general flow initially while maintaining grip and protection, then angle towards the edge and route to safety when possible
D) Sit the principal on the floor and wait for the crowd to pass

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Moving directly against a strong crowd flow is extremely difficult and increases crush risk. It is often safer to move with the flow at first while maintaining physical contact and protection, then work towards the edge and break away towards a safer route once conditions allow.

Question 14 [Medium]
During an emergency evacuation inside a shopping centre, the principal looks confused but is still mobile. What is the BEST way for the CPO to communicate with them?

A) Use short, clear commands such as “Move now, this way, stay with me” while guiding them
B) Stop and give a detailed explanation of the threat so they understand
C) Ask the principal what they would prefer to do and follow their suggestion
D) Speak quietly and indirectly so as not to alarm other people

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In emergencies, the principal needs clear, simple instructions and confident leadership, not long explanations or choices. Direct commands such as “Move now” and “Stay with me” help keep them focused and cooperative while the CPO maintains control and protection.

Question 15 [Medium]
While moving the principal along a corridor towards an exit under a potential threat, you approach a blind corner. How should this be handled?

A) Maintain maximum speed and turn tightly around the corner to minimise time exposed
B) Place the principal at the front so they can turn quickly if needed
C) Stop completely at every corner and wait for full intelligence before moving
D) Reduce speed, check and cover the corner before turning, then move past it quickly with the principal protected

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Corridors and corners are classic ambush points. The team should slow slightly, check and cover the corner, and then pass it quickly while keeping the principal shielded. This balances caution with the need to keep moving towards safety.

Question 16 [Medium]
You are escorting a principal to a vehicle in a car park. Which of the following BEST describes correct embus procedure at the passenger door?

A) Allow the principal to reach the vehicle first, then unlock and open the door
B) The CPO reaches the vehicle first, opens the door, shields the opening, the principal enters quickly, and the CPO closes the door immediately
C) The CPO opens all doors to give the principal multiple options
D) The CPO gets into the vehicle first to check it while the principal waits exposed

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: During embus, the CPO should arrive first, open and shield the door, move the principal into the vehicle quickly, and then close the door immediately. This minimises the time the principal is exposed and keeps the door opening protected.

Question 17 [Medium]
An explosion has occurred in a hotel foyer. The principal insists on going back to “help the injured” instead of evacuating. What is the MOST appropriate response from the CPO?

A) Allow the principal to help as long as the CPO stays close
B) Physically drag the principal away without saying anything
C) Use firm, authoritative communication to explain the need to move now, then apply an appropriate escort grip to guide them to safety
D) Let the principal continue while the team checks for secondary devices

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A principal wanting to help is understandable but dangerous in a high‑risk environment with possible secondary threats. The CPO should use clear, firm communication to assert the need to evacuate and, if required, apply a proportionate escort grip to move the principal to safety.

Question 18 [Medium]
Which statement BEST describes the purpose of a PRIMARY rally point in team evacuation planning?

A) A pre‑designated safe location where all team members regroup if separated during an incident
B) The first cover position chosen by the CPO engaging the threat
C) A location used only if the primary evacuation fails, but kept secret from the team
D) Any nearby public place used for informal debriefs after an operation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A primary rally point is a pre‑arranged meeting place for the team if they become separated. Everyone knows it in advance so they can regroup, account for the principal and each other, and then continue the mission or move to further safety.

Question 19 [Hard]
Your principal’s vehicle is caught in traffic when gunfire erupts from the right‑hand side. The engine is hit and the vehicle stalls; rounds continue to strike the car. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?

A) Order the driver to keep trying to restart the engine while everyone remains inside
B) Instruct the principal to stay seated while all CPOs dismount to locate the shooter
C) Tell the driver to sound the horn and push through traffic, regardless of engine damage
D) Use the vehicle as temporary cover while the CPO exits on the non‑contact side, shields the principal’s debus, and moves them quickly to better cover or alternative transport

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A compromised vehicle in a kill zone should be abandoned if necessary. Under threat, the CPO should debus on the safer side, using the vehicle as cover, shield the principal’s exit, and move them rapidly to better cover or an alternate vehicle or escape route. Staying inside a disabled, targeted vehicle is highly dangerous.

Question 20 [Hard]
A four‑person team is moving the principal down a wide corridor towards an exit when a gunman appears from behind and fires. The team leader calls, “Contact rear!”. According to contact drills, what should the next command be?

A) “Contact rear, evacuate rear!”
B) “Contact rear, evacuate forward!”
C) “Get down and stay where you are!”
D) “Contact front, evacuate rear!”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: With a Contact Rear, the correct response is to evacuate forward, away from the direction of the threat. Rear security engages or delays the attacker while the rest of the team moves the principal rapidly towards safety in front.

Question 21 [Hard]
You are moving a principal quickly through a busy hotel lobby after receiving intelligence of a possible protest nearby. The principal is distracted and slowing down, but there is no active attack yet. You need more control over their speed and direction while still maintaining their dignity and keeping things low‑key. Which escort grip is MOST appropriate?

A) Light guide on the back or shoulder
B) Wrist escort
C) Elbow escort
D) Full arm escort

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The elbow escort offers more control than a light guide while still appearing professional and respectful. It allows the CPO to influence speed and direction without using the high‑control, high‑profile wrist or full arm escorts that are more suited to emergencies.

Question 22 [Hard]
During a major incident in a shopping centre, communications fail and your route to the PRIMARY rally point is blocked by fire and structural damage. Earlier, the team leader briefed a primary, alternate, and emergency rally point. What should you do with the principal?

A) Move the principal to the ALTERNATE rally point as previously briefed
B) Return to the last place you saw other team members and wait there
C) Stay at a nearby “safe‑looking” spot and ignore the rally plan
D) Choose a new rally point based on convenience and inform the team later

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rally points are pre‑planned for exactly this situation. If the primary rally point is compromised, the team should use the alternate location. This allows separated elements to regroup in a safe, known place without needing live communication.
