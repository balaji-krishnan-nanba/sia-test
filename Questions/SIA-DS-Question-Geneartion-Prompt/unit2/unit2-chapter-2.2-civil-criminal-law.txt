--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.2: TRESPASS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:
- Entering or remaining on property without permission
- Permission can be withdrawn at any time
- Once asked to leave, person becomes trespasser

KEY POINT: Trespass is a CIVIL matter, NOT criminal
- Police cannot arrest for simple trespass
- It is NOT a crime to trespass
- But there are remedies and powers to deal with it

Licence to Enter:
- Open venues give "implied licence" to enter
- Subject to conditions (dress code, behaviour, etc.)
- Licence can be withdrawn at any time
- "You are no longer welcome, please leave"

Creating a Trespasser:
- Person with permission → asked to leave → refuses → trespasser
- Person entering without permission → trespasser from outset
- Person breaching conditions → may become trespasser

Reasonable Time to Leave:
- Must give person reasonable time to leave
- Cannot immediately use force
- What is reasonable depends on circumstances
- Once time passed and still present → can use reasonable force

Reasonable Force to Eject:
- Can use reasonable force to remove trespasser
- Force must be necessary and proportionate
- Minimum force required to achieve ejection
- Cannot use excessive force
- Physical removal is lawful if done properly

Aggravated Trespass (Criminal Offence):
- Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
- Trespass with intent to intimidate, obstruct, or disrupt
- This IS a criminal offence
- Example: protesters occupying premises

Trespass from the Outset:
- Person enters for unlawful purpose
- Never had genuine permission
- Example: enters to steal, assault, or deal drugs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.3: ASSAULT AND BATTERY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assault (Legal Definition):
- Causing someone to FEAR immediate unlawful violence
- Does NOT require physical contact
- The threat alone is assault
- Words and actions that cause fear
- Example: raising fist, threatening words, aggressive approach

Battery (Legal Definition):
- Actual application of unlawful force
- ANY unwanted touching can be battery
- Does not need to cause injury
- Example: pushing, punching, grabbing

Common Assault:
- Minor assault or battery
- No significant injury
- SUMMARY offence (Magistrates' Court only)
- NO power of citizen's arrest

Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm (ABH):
- Section 47 Offences Against the Person Act 1861
- Injury that is more than trifling
- Examples: bruising, minor cuts, black eye
- EITHER WAY offence (indictable)
- Citizen's arrest IS possible

Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) - Section 20:
- Section 20 Offences Against the Person Act 1861
- Serious injury (wounding or GBH)
- "Wounding" = breaking of the skin
- Reckless as to causing harm
- EITHER WAY offence (indictable)
- Citizen's arrest IS possible

GBH with Intent - Section 18:
- Section 18 Offences Against the Person Act 1861
- Most serious assault offence
- Intent to cause grievous bodily harm
- INDICTABLE ONLY (Crown Court)
- Maximum penalty: life imprisonment
- Citizen's arrest IS possible

Hierarchy of Assault Offences (least to most serious):

3. GBH - Section 20 (either way - arrest possible)
4. GBH with Intent - Section 18 (indictable - arrest possible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.4: USE OF FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3 Criminal Law Act 1967:
"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the 
prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of 
offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large."

Common Law Self-Defence:
- Defence of self
- Defence of others
- Defence of property

When Force is Justified:
- Prevention of crime
- Self-defence or defence of others
- Defence of property
- Lawful arrest
- Ejecting trespassers

Requirements for Lawful Force:

1. NECESSARY:
- Force must be needed
- No reasonable alternative available
- Cannot use force if you can walk away
- But no duty to retreat if threat is imminent

2. REASONABLE:
- What would an ordinary person consider reasonable?
- Judged on circumstances as they appeared at the time
- Not with hindsight
- Consider: size, numbers, weapons, threats

3. PROPORTIONATE:
- Level of force matches level of threat
- Minimum force needed to achieve aim
- Cannot use sledgehammer to crack a nut
- Escalation only if threat escalates

Honest Belief Test:
- Force judged on circumstances as YOU believed them
- Even if mistaken about facts
- Belief must be honestly held
- But must be reasonable in circumstances
- Genuine mistake can still be lawful

Pre-emptive Action:
- Do NOT have to wait to be hit first
- Can act if attack is imminent
- Pre-emptive strike CAN be lawful
- But must still be necessary and proportionate

When Force Becomes UNLAWFUL:
- Threat has ended
- Person is restrained/subdued
- Person is fleeing
- Retaliation (getting revenge)
- Punishment (teaching a lesson)
- Force continues after no longer needed
- Excessive force beyond what was needed

Excessive Force = Assault:
- If force is excessive, door supervisor commits assault
- Can face criminal charges
- Can face civil claim
- Loss of SIA licence
- Loss of employment

Occupier's Liability Act 1957:

Occupier's Liability Act 1984:
- Limited duty to trespassers
- Only for known dangers
- Less protection than lawful visitors
- Still cannot create traps/hazards

Duty to Ejected Persons:
- Still owe duty of care
- Cannot eject into dangerous situation

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.2: CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW FOR DOOR SUPERVISORS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
Trespass is generally considered to be what type of matter?

A) A criminal offence
B) A civil matter
C) A regulatory offence
D) An indictable offence

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Simple trespass is a civil matter, not a criminal offence. 
Police cannot arrest someone for ordinary trespass. However, the occupier 
can use reasonable force to remove a trespasser, and aggravated trespass 
(with intent to intimidate, obstruct or disrupt) is a criminal offence.
