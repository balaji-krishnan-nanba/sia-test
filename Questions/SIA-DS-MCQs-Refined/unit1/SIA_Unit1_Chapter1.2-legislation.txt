A) Beyond reasonable doubt
B) On the balance of probabilities
C) Clear and convincing evidence

A) Civil law
B) Administrative law
C) Criminal law

A) Beyond reasonable doubt
B) Balance of probabilities
C) Clear and convincing certainty

C) A qualified right that must be balanced against other interests

Q21 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor refuses entry to a pregnant woman, saying, "We don't want any trouble if something happens to your baby." Which is the most accurate statement?

A) This is acceptable because he is worried about safety
B) This is likely unlawful discrimination because pregnancy is protected
C) This is acceptable if the venue is very busy

Question: A venue policy states "No one over 25 allowed in on Fridays" without any justification. Which statement best describes this policy under the Equality Act 2010?

B) It may be discriminatory because age is a protected characteristic
C) It is lawful as long as it is written down

---
Q24 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A club has a dress code banning all head coverings. A Sikh man wearing a turban and a Muslim woman wearing a hijab are refused entry. Which is the best description of the potential issue under the Equality Act?

A) Direct discrimination because they were treated the same
B) Indirect discrimination because a neutral rule disadvantages certain religions
C) Harassment because staff spoke to them politely
D) Victimisation because they asked to see the manager

Answer: B
Explanation: A rule that applies to everyone but disproportionately disadvantages people with certain religious beliefs can amount to indirect discrimination. The policy would need strong justification to be lawful.

---
Q25 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: What is direct discrimination under the Equality Act 2010?

A) Applying a policy that accidentally disadvantages some people
B) Treating someone worse because they did not complain

C) Making a joke about someone's accent

---
Q27 | Difficulty: Medium

Question: A venue introduces a rule that all security staff must be over 30 "because they are more mature". What type of discrimination could this be?

A) Direct discrimination based on age
B) Indirect discrimination based on age
C) Harassment on grounds of age
D) Victimisation of older workers

Answer: A
Explanation: Refusing to hire or retain staff purely because they are under 30 treats them less favourably because of age. Age is a protected characteristic, so this is likely to be direct discrimination unless it can be objectively justified.

---
Question: A female customer is repeatedly subjected to sexual jokes by a member of the security team, making her feel intimidated. What form of unlawful conduct does this describe?

---
Q29 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A new entry policy states that all customers must remove religious symbols "to keep things neutral". This mainly affects people of certain faiths. What type of discrimination is this most likely to be?

A) Direct discrimination because everyone is treated differently
B) Indirect discrimination because a neutral rule disadvantages some religious groups
C) Harassment because customers feel embarrassed
D) Victimisation because customers might complain

Answer: B
Explanation: A neutral rule that applies to everyone but puts those with particular religious beliefs at a disadvantage can amount to indirect discrimination. It would need strong, proportionate justification to be lawful.

A) Using the ramp is optional and up to staff
B) Using the ramp may be a reasonable adjustment the venue should make
C) The customer must find another venue
D) The customer should pay extra for staff to use the ramp

A) Keeping CCTV footage forever
B) Collecting as much data as possible "just in case"

---
Q35 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor writes an incident report including a customer's full name, address, date of birth and detailed medical history, even though only their name and a brief description are needed. Which principle is most likely to have been breached?

A) Accuracy
B) Purpose limitation
C) Data minimisation
D) Integrity and confidentiality

Answer: C

A) Storage limitation
B) Accuracy
C) Purpose limitation
D) Integrity and confidentiality

Answer: A

---
Q37 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A colleague asks to look at an incident report "just because I'm curious", even though they were not involved and do not need to know. According to data protection principles, what should the security operative do?

A) Show the report as long as they are a colleague
B) Refuse access because information should be shared on a need-to-know basis
C) Let them read it but not take a copy
D) Read it aloud instead of showing it

Answer: B
Explanation: The integrity and confidentiality principle requires personal data to be kept secure and only accessed by people who have a legitimate need to know. Curiosity is not a lawful reason to access personal information.

---
Q38 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: After an email containing customers' personal details is sent to the wrong person, the manager decides not to tell anyone because "it's only a small mistake". Which two obligations under data protection law might this decision fail to meet?

A) Data minimisation and purpose limitation
B) Accountability and breach reporting within 72 hours where required
C) Lawfulness and data portability
D) Storage limitation and transparency

Answer: B
Explanation: Organisations must be accountable for how they handle personal data and, where a breach is likely to risk individuals' rights and freedoms, they must report it to the ICO without undue delay and within 72 hours. Failing to assess and record the breach properly may breach these duties. Note: The 72-hour reporting requirement only applies to breaches likely to result in risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, not all breaches.

A) Right to demand cash compensation immediately
B) Right of access to their personal data
C) Right to stop all CCTV in public places

---
Q40 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A customer asks to see the information a venue holds about them, including CCTV footage of an incident. How should the security team view this request?

A) As a subject access request which may need to be passed to management
B) As harassment which can be ignored
C) As a breach of the Data Protection Act
D) As a criminal offence

Answer: A
Explanation: Individuals have the right of access to personal data held about them. A request to see records or CCTV is a subject access request and should be handled according to the organisation's procedures, usually by management or a data protection lead.

C) Right to restrict processing
D) Right to rectification
