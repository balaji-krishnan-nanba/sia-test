UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.4: PHYSICAL INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the correct angle for the interview stance relative to the threat?

A) Square on (0 degrees)
B) Bladed (approximately 45 degrees)
C) Side on (90 degrees)
D) Back turned (180 degrees)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The interview stance should be bladed at about 45 degrees to the subject. This reduces the target area, improves balance and mobility, and still looks non‑aggressive compared with a square‑on fighting stance.

Question 2 [Medium]
Which option best describes a professional interview stance when dealing with a potentially aggressive subject?

A) Feet together, body square-on, weight on both heels, hands in pockets
B) Feet wider than shoulders, leaning heavily on the front foot, hands hanging by the sides
C) Feet shoulder‑width apart, body bladed about 45 degrees, weight mainly on the back foot, knees slightly bent, hands open and visible above the waist
D) One foot directly in front of the other, legs straight, arms folded across the chest

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A correct interview stance is balanced and “ready”: body bladed around 45 degrees, feet shoulder‑width apart, weight mostly on the back foot, knees slightly bent and hands open and visible above the waist. This gives a position of advantage without looking aggressive.

Question 3 [Hard]
You are speaking with an agitated individual who suddenly steps towards you and is now within touching distance. What is the most appropriate immediate action in terms of stance and positioning?

A) Square up directly in front of them with your hands by your sides
B) Step closer to show authority and prevent them walking away
C) Turn fully side‑on but remain at the same (very close) distance
D) Take a small step back to at least arm’s length, blade your body about 45 degrees and bring your hands up into a “fence”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The priority is to re‑establish a reactionary gap while staying non‑aggressive. Stepping back to at least arm’s length, adopting a bladed stance and raising the hands into a fence gives space, protection and time to react, while still supporting de‑escalation.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which description best matches the purpose and shape of a cover block?

A) Arms wrapped tightly around the head with elbows close together and chin tucked, used as a survival posture against multiple or heavy strikes
B) One arm raised above the head, forearm vertical, used only against a single overhead strike
C) Hands held low in front of the body to protect the groin from kicks
D) One hand extended to catch and hold the attacker’s striking limb

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A cover block is a protective shell using both forearms and elbows tight around the head, with the chin tucked. It is a survival technique to protect vital areas and buy time when under heavy or repeated attack.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which principle best describes effective deflection (parrying) of a punch rather than a hard block?

A) Meeting the incoming strike with maximum force to stop it dead
B) Trying to catch the fist firmly and hold it in place
C) Guiding the attack past you at an angle with light contact and minimal energy
D) Pushing the attacking arm straight back towards the attacker’s body

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Deflection and parrying are about redirecting, not colliding with, the attack. Light contact that guides the strike off‑line at an angle uses less energy, reduces injury risk and can create openings to move, escape or control.

Question 6 [Easy]
A subject grabs your wrist with one hand. What is the key principle for releasing from this wrist grab?

A) Rotate your wrist explosively against the attacker’s thumb and then move away
B) Pull straight back as hard as possible, using strength
C) Twist in the same direction as the attacker’s fingers to “spin out” of the grip
D) Bend your wrist sharply towards the attacker’s palm to lock their hand

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The thumb is the weakest part of the grip. Rotating your wrist against the thumb, using a quick, explosive movement, breaks the hold efficiently. You should then create distance and prepare for further action.

Question 7 [Medium]
You are grabbed in a front bear hug with your arms free. What is the BEST initial response?

A) Relax and let them squeeze fully so they tire themselves out
B) Try to pull directly forwards out of their arms using strength
C) Jump up to make yourself heavier so they cannot move you
D) Use your forearms and hands to frame against their hips or chest to stop the pressure, drop your weight to create space, then push away and move to safety

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: With arms free, you can “frame” against the attacker’s body to prevent them closing you down. Dropping your weight and using this structure creates space, allows you to break their balance and then push away to escape.

Question 8 [Hard]
A subject suddenly grabs your throat with both hands from the front and starts to squeeze. Breathing feels restricted. What is the most appropriate immediate response?

A) Step back slowly and ask them to loosen their grip
B) Tuck your chin, explosively strip their hands away at the thumbs, then move off and create distance while preparing to defend further
C) Allow the grip to continue while you try to talk them down
D) Ignore the grip and focus on applying an escort hold to their arm

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A choke or strangle is potentially life‑threatening and demands immediate action. Tucking the chin, attacking the weakest point (the thumbs) and “plucking” the hands off rapidly protects the airway. You then create distance and prepare for further attack.

Question 9 [Easy]
Why are palm strikes often preferred over closed‑fist punches in defensive situations?

A) They are less visible on CCTV
B) They guarantee no injury to the subject
C) They reduce the chance of injuring your own hand while still delivering effective force
D) They are the only type of strike that is legally acceptable

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Palm strikes use the heel of the hand, which is less likely to be damaged on hard targets such as the skull or jaw. This makes them a practical defensive option while still being effective, provided they are lawful, necessary and proportionate.

Question 10 [Medium]
A subject has grabbed the front of your clothing and pulled you very close so there is almost no space between you. Which strike is generally most appropriate to create an opportunity to escape?

A) A short elbow strike to the subject’s upper body or face
B) A spinning back kick to the subject’s mid‑section
C) A long‑range palm strike delivered from arm’s length
D) A high roundhouse kick to the subject’s head

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: At very close range, long kicks or extended punches are impractical. Elbows and knees are designed for close‑quarter situations, and a short, committed elbow strike can create the space needed to break contact and move away, assuming it is lawful and proportionate.

Question 11 [Medium]
Which target area is generally MOST appropriate when delivering a proportionate strike to stop an attack and create an opportunity to escape, while reducing the risk of serious injury?

A) The throat
B) The thigh or other large muscle of the leg
C) The back of the head
D) The spine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Striking large muscle groups such as the thigh can disrupt movement and cause pain without the same level of risk as attacks to vulnerable areas like the throat, spine or back of the head, which can be extremely dangerous and are usually inappropriate unless facing a life‑threatening assault.

Question 12 [Easy]
When confronted by a person armed with a knife at several metres distance, what should be your FIRST priority, in line with general weapon‑defence principles?

A) Attempt to disarm them using hand techniques
B) Close the distance quickly so they cannot swing the knife
C) Stay where you are and argue with the person
D) Escape and create as much distance as possible, using barriers if you can

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: With any weapon, but especially an edged weapon, the priority is survival, not “winning”. The first option should be to escape and increase distance, using barriers or cover where possible. Directly engaging a knife‑armed attacker is extremely high risk.

Question 13 [Medium]
You see a subject display a knife while shouting at you across a bar area. There is an open route to the side and a heavy table between you and the subject. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Walk straight towards them to show confidence and take control
B) Stand still and try to negotiate while remaining directly in front of them
C) Move away using the open route, placing the table and other solid objects between you and the subject while calling for help
D) Jump onto the table and prepare to kick the knife out of their hand

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The priorities are escape, distance and barriers. Moving away along a safe route and using the table as a barrier reduces the chance of being reached with the weapon and buys time to summon assistance and protect others.

Question 14 [Hard]
During a robbery, a person suddenly produces a handgun at close range and demands valuables. You are unarmed and there is no immediate safe escape route. What is the most appropriate general approach?

A) Comply with instructions while looking for any safe opportunity to escape or move the principal to safety; do not attempt to disarm unless there is no other option and life is in immediate danger
B) Immediately grab the weapon with both hands and wrestle it away
C) Launch a pre‑emptive elbow strike to the face before they can react
D) Push the principal behind you and charge straight at the gunman

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Firearms present an extreme threat. Unarmed disarms are very high risk and should only be considered as an absolute last resort when there is no alternative and life is clearly in immediate danger. Compliance and looking for a safe chance to escape or protect the principal is usually the safest option.

Question 15 [Easy]
Which escort method provides the LOWEST level of physical control and is most suitable for guiding a compliant person in a low‑risk situation?

A) Wrist escort
B) Arm escort
C) Elbow escort
D) Light guide

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A light guide uses a gentle hand on the back or shoulder purely to direct movement. It is discreet, low‑key and appropriate where the person is generally cooperative and only minimal physical guidance is required.

Question 16 [Medium]
You are escorting a mildly resistant but still walking individual away from a venue. You need more control than a light guide but still want to maintain their dignity. Which technique is most appropriate?

A) Wrist escort with a firm grip, pulling the person rapidly
B) Elbow escort with a controlled grip while walking at a steady pace
C) Two‑person arm lock applied quickly from behind
D) A neck hold to “steer” the person towards the exit

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The elbow escort provides more control than a light guide without being overly aggressive. A firm but professional grip on the elbow can influence direction and pace while still maintaining the person’s dignity and safety.

Question 17 [Medium]
Which statement about taking a person to the ground is MOST accurate?

A) The aim is to throw them down as hard as possible to shock them into compliance
B) The surface is not important as long as you gain control quickly
C) You should use trained methods to guide them down in a controlled way, maintaining contact and aiming to minimise injury
D) Once the person is on the ground, you should keep them there as long as possible regardless of circumstances

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Takedowns should be controlled, using taught techniques that manage the person’s descent and landing. The goal is necessary control with minimum force and reduced injury risk, not to slam or drop the person.

Question 18 [Hard]
You and a colleague are struggling with a resistant subject at the top of a flight of stairs next to a glass wall. Someone suggests taking the person to the ground immediately. What is the best decision?

A) Avoid a takedown in this hazardous area; attempt to move the person to a safer location or maintain standing control while calling for further assistance
B) Sweep their legs so they land on the stairs, as this will stop the struggle quickly
C) Drive them backwards into the glass to pin them and then take them down
D) Ignore the environment and perform a powerful hip throw to end the fight

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Environmental hazards such as stairs and glass greatly increase the risk of serious injury. Physical intervention must be proportionate and as safe as possible. If a takedown is necessary, it should be on the safest available surface; otherwise, maintain standing control and seek support.

Question 19 [Easy]
Which of the following is a key benefit of using a team approach to physical intervention?

A) It removes the need to complete documentation afterwards
B) It allows operatives to use any level of force they choose
C) It means one operative can leave and “let the others deal with it”
D) It improves safety and control by sharing roles and providing witnesses and backup

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Teamwork increases safety for everyone. Multiple operatives can share control tasks, monitor the surroundings, and act as witnesses, leading to more professional and accountable interventions.

Question 20 [Medium]
Two close protection operatives need to escort a resistant but moving subject from a venue. How should they position themselves for a standard two‑person walking escort?

A) Both behind the subject, pushing them forwards
B) One on each side of the subject, using matched grips, moving at the same pace and giving coordinated verbal commands
C) One in front pulling, one behind pushing
D) Both on the same side of the subject so the other side is free

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In a two‑person escort, operatives position themselves either side of the subject with similar grips, matching pace and communicating clearly. This balances control, protects everyone’s safety and maintains a professional appearance.

Question 21 [Medium]
During a three‑person physical intervention, how should communication with the subject and between team members be managed?

A) All operatives should shout instructions at the subject at the same time
B) One operative should be designated as lead communicator, giving clear commands while others focus on their control roles and monitoring the surroundings
C) The operative nearest the subject’s head should improvise all instructions without informing the others
D) Once physical control is gained, further communication is unnecessary

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Team techniques rely on clear, coordinated communication. Having a designated lead communicator avoids confusion and mixed messages, while the other team members concentrate on safe control and situational awareness.
