UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.4: CONTROL ROOM PROCEDURES
Question 1 [Easy] – Shift Handover

In a CCTV control room, what is the MAIN reason for carrying out a formal shift handover between operators?

A) To give the outgoing operator time to tidy their desk
B) To ensure continuity of operations and transfer of key information
C) To check the operator’s personal equipment and uniform
D) To reset all cameras to their home positions

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The primary purpose of a shift handover is to ensure continuity of operations and an effective transfer of information between operators. This includes ongoing incidents, intelligence, equipment status, and partner updates. A good handover prevents gaps in monitoring and supports accountability.

Question 2 [Easy] – Shift Handover

During handover, which of the following would normally be recorded under equipment status?

A) Names of persons currently being monitored
B) Details of planned police operations later in the week
C) Any camera faults and recording problems noticed during the shift
D) Requests from operators for annual leave

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Equipment status in a handover focuses on issues such as camera faults, recording problems, communication failures and scheduled maintenance. These affect the technical capability of the system and must be clearly passed on. Other items, like police operations, are important but belong under intelligence or partner updates.

Question 3 [Medium] – Shift Handover (Scenario)

Ten minutes before the end of their shift, a CCTV operator is tracking a suspicious vehicle linked to recent thefts. What is the MOST appropriate action regarding handover?

A) Give the incoming operator a clear briefing on the vehicle, its last known location and outstanding actions
B) Stop following the vehicle and leave it to the police to update the next operator
C) Ignore the incident because it is nearly the end of the shift
D) Continue to track the vehicle into their own time without telling the incoming operator

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Ongoing incidents, including persons or vehicles being tracked and any outstanding actions, must be handed over clearly. A verbal briefing ensures the incoming operator understands the current situation and can continue monitoring without gaps. Simply stopping or failing to brief undermines continuity and accountability.

Question 4 [Hard] – Shift Handover (Scenario)

A complaint is investigated after a serious incident was missed during a shift change. The review shows the outgoing operator gave a brief “all quiet” comment and left without completing any documentation. Which improvement would have MOST reduced the risk of this failure?

A) Allowing the outgoing operator to leave as soon as their shift time ended
B) Asking the incoming operator to read previous days’ logs at the end of their shift
C) Relying on the police to update the new operator by phone
D) Completing a written handover log that both operators sign to confirm the information passed

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
A written handover record, acknowledged by both operators, creates a permanent record of what was passed over and clearly transfers responsibility. It supports accountability and can be referred to if something is missed. Relying on informal comments or others (like police) is not a substitute for proper handover documentation.

Question 5 [Easy] – Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

In a CCTV control room, what are Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)?

A) Written instructions that set out how normal operations and responses should be carried out
B) Informal tips shared between operators during quiet periods
C) Criminal law documents that apply to CCTV systems
D) Equipment manuals provided by camera manufacturers

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
SOPs are written instructions covering normal operations, incident responses, communication and other routine tasks. They provide consistency, support training and demonstrate that staff are working to agreed standards. They are more than informal advice or technical manuals.

Question 6 [Medium] – SOPs (Application)

An operator faces an unusual situation that is not clearly covered by existing SOPs. What is the MOST appropriate way to deal with it?

A) Ignore the incident to avoid making a mistake
B) Use professional judgement, seek guidance from a supervisor and document the decision taken
C) Write a new SOP on the spot and put it in the folder
D) Ask a colleague informally and avoid recording any decisions

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
When SOPs don’t cover a situation, operators should use their professional judgement but also seek guidance from a supervisor if needed. The decision and reasons should be documented so the situation can be reviewed and SOPs updated later if appropriate. Ignoring incidents or hiding decisions is unprofessional and risky.

Question 7 [Hard] – SOPs & Evidence (Scenario)

During a court case, the defence argues that CCTV evidence is unreliable because control room procedures were not followed. Which of the following failures would MOST support this argument?

A) The operator wore a different coloured shirt from the usual uniform
B) The operator used capital letters when writing their log
C) The incident log missed key actions and times that were required by the SOP
D) The operator used the phonetic alphabet on the radio

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
SOPs often specify how incidents are recorded, including actions, timings and who was informed. Missing key details required by SOPs can undermine the integrity of the evidence and raise doubts about the professionalism of the operation. Uniform colour or using phonetic alphabet would not normally affect evidential value.

Question 8 [Easy] – Systematic Monitoring

Which option BEST describes systematic monitoring in a CCTV control room?

A) Only watching cameras when someone phones in with a complaint
B) Repeatedly staring at a single camera that looks busy
C) Randomly picking cameras depending on what interests the operator
D) Using planned patrol patterns to ensure regular coverage of cameras and priority areas

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Systematic monitoring means following planned patterns to ensure all relevant areas, especially high‑risk ones, receive regular attention. This helps detect incidents proactively and prevents gaps in coverage. Simply reacting or focusing on one camera is not systematic.

Question 9 [Medium] – Patrol Patterns

Which camera patrol pattern provides simple, systematic coverage but may become predictable to offenders?

A) Sequentially viewing camera 1, then 2, then 3, and so on in order
B) Only viewing cameras after requests from partners
C) Viewing only high‑risk cameras and ignoring the rest
D) Choosing cameras at random with no pattern at all

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Sequential patrols (camera 1, then 2, then 3, etc.) are easy to follow and ensure all cameras get some attention. However, if used alone they can become predictable, allowing offenders to time their actions between checks. That’s why systems often mix in priority and random elements.

Question 10 [Medium] – Time-Based Monitoring (Scenario)

A town centre is quiet during the day but very busy with nightlife at weekends. Which monitoring approach would BEST ensure cameras are used efficiently?

A) Using the same fixed patrol pattern at all times of day and night
B) Adapting patrol patterns so high‑risk nightlife areas are viewed more often during busy periods
C) Turning off cameras in quiet areas completely
D) Only responding to calls from the police and not carrying out proactive patrols

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Time‑based monitoring adapts patrols to different times, focusing on rush hour, night‑time economy or special events when risk is higher. This makes better use of limited resources and supports proactive surveillance. A fixed pattern or purely reactive approach is less effective.

Question 11 [Easy] – Incident Logging Basics

Which of the following should ALWAYS be included when logging a CCTV incident?

A) The operator’s personal opinion of the suspect
B) Guesses about what might happen next
C) The time, date and camera reference used
D) The operator’s feelings about the shift

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Every incident log should record the time, date and camera reference, along with what was observed, actions taken and the outcome. Logs must be factual and based on observations, not opinions or guesses. Personal feelings are irrelevant and unprofessional in an incident record.

Question 12 [Medium] – Correcting Errors in Logs

While completing a paper incident log, an operator realises they wrote the wrong time for when the police were called. What is the MOST appropriate way to correct this?

A) Scribble over the wrong time until it cannot be read
B) Use correction fluid (e.g. Tipp‑Ex) to hide the original entry
C) Tear out the page and start again
D) Strike through the incorrect time with a single line, write the correct time and add initials, date and time of the correction

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Incident logs are legal records and must not be altered in a way that hides the original entry. Errors should be crossed out with a single line so they remain readable, then corrected with a note of who made the change and when. This preserves the integrity and audit trail of the record.

Question 13 [Hard] – Contemporaneous Logging (Scenario)

An operator deals with a disturbance seen on camera but is busy with other tasks and only writes up the log at the end of their eight‑hour shift. Which is the MAIN problem with this approach?

A) The record is not contemporaneous and relies on memory rather than being written at the time
B) The log is too neat and clearly written
C) The operator did not include their personal opinions about those involved
D) The police were informed during the incident

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Incident logs should be contemporaneous – written at the time of the incident or as soon as possible while memory is fresh. Waiting until the end of a long shift increases the risk of omissions and inaccuracies. This can weaken the evidential value of the log.

Question 14 [Easy] – Radio Procedure

Before transmitting on a shared radio channel, what should a CCTV operator do FIRST?

A) Press the transmit button and start speaking immediately
B) Listen to ensure the channel is clear before transmitting
C) Turn the volume down so other operators aren’t disturbed
D) Assume others will stop talking when they hear them

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Good radio discipline requires operators to listen first to ensure they do not “talk over” someone else. Once the channel is clear, they should identify themselves and the recipient and then give a clear, concise message. This keeps the radio net efficient and professional.

Question 15 [Medium] – Passing Information (Scenario)

An operator sees a suspicious male loitering near parked vehicles and needs to update the police by radio. What is the BEST way to give the description?

A) “There’s a dodgy‑looking bloke hanging around the cars, he looks trouble.”
B) “There’s someone I don’t like the look of, I think he’s up to something.”
C) “Male, late 20s, dark jacket with hood up, blue jeans, white trainers, currently near the multi‑storey entrance on Camera 12.”
D) “There was a man here earlier but he’s probably gone now, I’ll let you know if he comes back.”

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Radio messages should be clear, concise and factual. Descriptions should focus on observable details such as clothing, age, location and behaviour, not personal opinions. This helps responders identify the person quickly and accurately.

Question 16 [Medium] – Phonetic Alphabet

A CCTV operator must pass a vehicle registration to the police via radio, but the line is noisy. What is the MOST appropriate way to do this?

A) Say the registration quickly once and hope it is heard correctly
B) Shout the registration repeatedly until someone acknowledges it
C) Wait until the end of the shift and email the registration
D) Spell out the registration slowly using the standard phonetic alphabet and confirm it has been received correctly

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Using the phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.) improves clarity when passing important details like registrations. Speaking slowly and confirming the message has been understood reduces the chance of errors. Delays or rushed messages can cause confusion.

Question 17 [Easy] – Access Control

Why is strict access control to the CCTV control room so important?

A) To protect CCTV systems and footage, maintain confidentiality and safeguard evidence
B) To make it harder for staff to take breaks
C) To keep the room quiet for visitors
D) To ensure cleaning staff can enter whenever they wish

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The control room contains sensitive systems and images, so access must be limited to authorised persons only. This protects the security of the system, the confidentiality of images and the integrity of evidence. Poor access control can lead to data breaches and tampering.

Question 18 [Medium] – Unauthorised Access (Scenario)

An unknown person tries to follow (“tailgate”) an authorised engineer through the secure control room door. What should the CCTV operator on duty do?

A) Ignore it – if they got through the door, they must be allowed in
B) Challenge the person politely in line with procedures and verify their authorisation before allowing access
C) Hold the door open to be helpful
D) Let them in but leave them alone in the room while everyone else is busy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Operators should be security‑conscious and challenge anyone whose authority to enter is unclear. Tailgating is a common way for unauthorised individuals to gain access. Verification and escorting of visitors are key parts of access control procedures.

Question 19 [Easy] – Screen Breaks / DSE

Under Display Screen Equipment (DSE) guidance, what is the MOST appropriate approach to screen breaks for CCTV operators?

A) Take one long break after four hours of continuous viewing
B) Only take breaks at meal times
C) Take regular, short breaks away from the screens at least every hour
D) Avoid breaks completely during busy periods

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
DSE guidance recommends regular, short breaks away from display screens – ideally at least once an hour. This helps reduce eye strain, fatigue and musculoskeletal problems. Short, frequent breaks are better than infrequent long ones.

Question 20 [Medium] – Workstation Assessment

Which adjustment is MOST important to help reduce neck strain when setting up a CCTV workstation?

A) Turning the radio volume down
B) Moving the keyboard as far away as possible
C) Sitting on the edge of the chair without back support
D) Positioning the main monitor roughly at eye level, directly in front of the operator

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
A proper workstation assessment includes positioning the monitor at about eye level and directly in front of the operator, reducing the need to bend or twist the neck. Combined with an adjustable chair and good posture, this supports long‑term comfort. Poor positioning can contribute to neck and back pain.

Question 21 [Medium] – Stress and Wellbeing (Scenario)

After viewing distressing footage of a serious assault, an operator feels upset and finds it hard to concentrate. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Inform a supervisor and make use of available support, such as debriefing or counselling
B) Keep quiet and hope the feelings go away
C) Leave the building without telling anyone
D) Watch the footage again to “get used to it”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
CCTV work can involve distressing images, and operators should not struggle alone. Speaking to a supervisor allows support such as debriefing or access to counselling and ensures operational safety. Ignoring stress can affect health, judgement and performance.

Question 22 [Hard] – DSE / Ergonomics (Scenario)

A CCTV operator has been in the role for six months and reports headaches, eye strain and back pain after each shift. Which combination of actions BEST reflects good practice under DSE and health and safety procedures?

A) Continue working as normal but take stronger painkillers
B) Request a DSE workstation assessment, adjust chair and monitor appropriately and ensure regular breaks away from the screen
C) Stand up all shift with the monitor off to one side
D) Turn off some cameras to reduce the amount of viewing required

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
DSE regulations and ergonomic principles require employers to assess workstations and provide suitable equipment and guidance. Adjusting the chair, monitor position and work layout, combined with regular screen breaks, helps reduce strain. Painkillers or switching off cameras do not address the root causes and may be unsafe.

Question 23 [Easy] – Fire in the Control Room

The fire alarm sounds in the building while you are monitoring live cameras. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Keep watching the cameras until you can see if there is really a fire
B) Ignore the alarm unless smoke is visible in the control room
C) Follow the fire evacuation procedures immediately and go to the assembly point
D) Silence the alarm if the control room is busy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
In a fire situation, life safety comes first. Operators must follow the building’s fire procedures, which will normally mean leaving immediately by the designated route and reporting to the assembly point. CCTV operations can be resumed once it is safe to do so.

Question 24 [Hard] – System Failure (Scenario)

During a major town‑centre event, the CCTV monitors suddenly go blank due to a system failure. What should the operator do FIRST?

A) Wait to see if the pictures come back on their own
B) Switch off all power to the control room
C) Panic and leave the control room immediately
D) Follow the control room’s system‑failure procedures: report the fault immediately, activate any backup arrangements and start manual logging

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
System failures are an emergency for a CCTV control room and should be covered by specific procedures. The operator should report the fault straight away, activate backup systems (such as UPS, generators or alternative monitoring) and use manual logging to record events and actions. This helps maintain critical functions and informs partners.

Question 25 [Easy] – Quality Assurance

What is the MAIN purpose of quality assurance (QA) activities such as incident audits and log reviews in a CCTV control room?

A) To look for reasons to discipline operators
B) To maintain standards and improve performance by checking how incidents and logs are handled
C) To allow operators to avoid completing paperwork
D) To ensure that only the newest camera models are used

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Quality assurance is about maintaining and improving standards, not just blaming individuals. Reviewing incidents, logs and feedback helps identify training needs, procedural issues and good practice. It also demonstrates compliance and builds confidence with partners such as the police and local authorities.
