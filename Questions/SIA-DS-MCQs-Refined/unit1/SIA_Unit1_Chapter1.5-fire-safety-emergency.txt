Question: A venue's rear fire exit is discovered to be chained and padlocked from inside during pre-opening checks. Management says "We never use that exit, ignore it." What should you, as a door supervisor, do?

A) Accept their instruction and proceed
B) Remove the chain if safe, insist exit must be usable, and report the issue to management/responsible person before opening to public
C) Close the venue immediately regardless of their decision
D) Ignore and rely on other exits

Answer: B
Explanation: Fire exits must always be available and usable in case of emergency. A chained/padlocked exit is a serious fire safety breach. You must ensure it's usable and raise the concern — ignoring it is unsafe and likely unlawful.

---
Q32 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: Why is it dangerous to wedge open a self-closing fire door during normal operation?

A) It interferes with CCTV coverage
B) It could block ventilation
C) Fire and smoke can spread unchecked, invalidating compartmentation and creating hazard to escape routes

Answer: C
Explanation: Fire doors are designed to contain fire and smoke within compartments. Wedging them open removes that protection, allowing rapid spread and compromising escape routes.

---
Q33 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During a fire emergency in a venue, emergency lighting fails to operate. What is the potential impact — and what should have been done under fire safety obligations?

A) No major impact — people can use phone torches
B) Panic and disorientation; as part of fire precautions, emergency lighting should be maintained and tested regularly
C) Only a problem for staff, not customers
D) It's acceptable if the alarm sounded

Answer: B
Explanation: Emergency lighting ensures escape routes remain visible in power failure or smoke conditions. Under fire safety law, lighting must be maintained, tested regularly, and any failures fixed to allow safe evacuation.

---
Q34 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A small bin of waste paper ignites in a storeroom. You raise the alarm but the only extinguisher nearby is dry powder, and you are trained to use it. What should you do after raising the alarm?

A) Attempt to fight the fire using the dry powder extinguisher — if safe
B) Wait for the fire service even though fire might spread quickly
C) Carry the bin outside to extinguish it in the open
D) Ignore, because it's small

Answer: A

Q36 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You receive a telephone bomb threat at the venue. During the call, what is the BEST approach?

A) Hang up immediately and evacuate
B) Stay calm, try to keep the caller talking; ask relevant questions (location, time, description), and signal a colleague to alert management or police if possible
C) Argue with the caller to expose them
D) Ignore and wait for police instructions

Answer: B
Explanation: On receiving a bomb threat call you should keep calm, collect as much information as possible (e.g. device location, time, type), and alert others to call police — while continuing the call if safe to do so, to gather more info.

---
Q37 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: After the bomb threat call ends, what should you do before making any decision about evacuation or search?

A) Post about it on social media
B) Immediately evacuate everyone without consulting management
C) Report everything to management/police, make detailed written notes of the call while fresh, then await instructions — do not handle any suspicious items
D) Conduct a search yourself

Answer: C
Explanation: After a threat call, you must report it, document all details (caller voice, background sounds, time, content) and await guidance. Never handle or move suspicious items unless authorised and trained.

---
Q38 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A group of customers are trapped in a smoke-filled room because a fire has blocked the main exit. The alternate escape route is partly obstructed. What should be your immediate action?

A) Direct them back to the blocked exit
B) Tow them out as fast as possible
C) Use dynamic risk assessment — if safe, clear the obstruction on the escape route or guide them to any safe exit; otherwise wait for fire service instruction
D) Keep them where they are and send someone to call fire service

Answer: C
Explanation: In emergencies, you must assess risks and act accordingly — clear escape routes if safe, guide evacuees via safest available route, and avoid unnecessary risk. If unsafe, await fire service instructions.

---
Q39 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: Why is regular review of a fire risk assessment necessary after the initial assessment?

A) It helps to reduce insurance premiums
B) Building layout, occupancy, use, furniture, fire hazards and staff may change — reviews ensure fire safety measures stay appropriate
C) It updates the names of staff responsible
D) Only required when you apply for a licence

Answer: B
Explanation: Fire risk assessments must be reviewed regularly — especially after changes in layout, use or occupancy — because fire risks may change over time and controls must remain appropriate.

---
Q40 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A venue stores cleaning solvents, paint thinners and combustible liquids near an electrical panel. According to fire safety principles, what is the best action?

A) Leave them — they are stored inside cupboards
B) Move them into a designated flammable-storage cabinet away from ignition sources
C) Keep them close to fire extinguishers for easy access
D) Mix them in larger containers to reduce number of bottles

Answer: B
Explanation: Flammable liquids should be stored in proper, labelled flammable storage cabinets, away from ignition sources (including electrical panels), as part of control measures identified in the fire risk assessment.

---
Q41 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: As a door supervisor, you are told to wedge open a fire door to make it easier for staff carrying trays during busy periods. What is the correct response?

A) Do it — efficiency is important
B) Do it only during busy times, then close afterwards
C) Refuse — wedging open fire doors compromises means of escape and firespread protection, which is a serious safety breach
D) Ignore the instruction and hope no one notices

Answer: C
Explanation: Fire doors are critical for compartmentation and safe escape routes. Wedging them open removes those protections and constitutes a serious breach of fire safety — the instruction should be refused and reported.

---
Q42 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: In a premises with more than one "responsible person" (e.g. owner and a managing agent), what is required under the Fire Safety Order?

A) Only the owner remains responsible
B) They must cooperate to meet all fire safety duties together
C) Responsibility shifts to the occupier only
D) They can each ignore fire safety if they assume the other will handle it

C) Only install smoke detectors and call the fire brigade when needed
D) Only store flammables safely and leave rest to chance

Answer: B
Explanation: The Fire Safety Order requires a suitable and sufficient fire risk assessment; appropriate fire precautions (escape routes, detection, alarms, extinguishers, emergency planning); maintenance of systems; and training/instruction to staff.

---
Q44 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During an emergency evacuation, a staff member notices a person with mobility impairment at the top of a staircase who cannot descend quickly. According to best practise, what should happen?

A) Leave them and evacuate the rest — emergencies are not a time for delays
B) Attempt to carry them down the stairs in a hurry
C) Follow the pre-agreed Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) — assist them as planned or direct them to a refuge area if available and wait for assistance
D) Lock them in a room for their own safety

Answer: C
Explanation: For people with mobility or other impairments a PEEP should exist. Staff should follow the plan — which may include assisting them to safety or moving them to a refuge area and waiting for trained assistance — rather than rushing or abandoning them.
