BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Close Protection Operative
- 30 multiple choice questions
- 45 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (21 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.6) is one of 8 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Vehicle operations are a critical component of close protection. The 
principal spends significant time in vehicles, and this is when they are 
most vulnerable (80% of attacks occur in transit). Understanding embus/
debus drills, convoy procedures, and anti-ambush actions is essential.

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.6: VEHICLE OPERATIONS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
In the UK, where should the principal normally sit in the vehicle?

A) Front passenger seat
B) Rear nearside (behind front passenger)
C) Rear offside (behind driver)
D) Driver's seat

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In the UK, the principal normally sits rear nearside - behind 
the front passenger seat. This position allows the principal to exit onto 
the pavement (nearside) rather than into traffic. The front passenger seat 
is typically occupied by the PPO/CPO.
