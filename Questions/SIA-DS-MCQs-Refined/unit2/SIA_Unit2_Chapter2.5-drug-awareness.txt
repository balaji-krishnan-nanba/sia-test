C) Refuse entry because they appear under the influence of drugs
D) Call 999 immediately to have them arrested

Answer: C

---
Q16 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: During a search under your "condition of entry" policy, you find a number of small wraps of white powder, a set of digital scales and a large amount of cash on a customer. Why is this more serious than finding a single wrap of powder?

A) It means the drug is automatically Class A

C) It shows the customer must be under 18

B) The customer's star sign and favourite drink
C) Only the customer's name and address if known
D) Date, time, exact location, description of the item, who found it and any witnesses

Q21 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A customer claims that a bag of colourful pills you have seized are "just legal highs" and therefore allowed. Which statement best reflects the law under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016?

C) Possession of any psychoactive substance is always a criminal offence
D) The Act only applies inside prisons

Answer: B
Explanation: The Act targets the production and supply of psychoactive substances intended for human consumption, regardless of how they are advertised. Simple possession is generally not an offence outside custodial institutions, but supply can carry up to seven years' imprisonment.

---
Q22 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: You suspect a customer's drink has been spiked. What should you do with the drink?

A) Pour it away immediately for hygiene reasons
B) Offer it to another customer if it looks untouched

Q23 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Inside a hot nightclub, a young man who has been dancing non-stop for hours is extremely hot, sweating heavily, chewing gum constantly and drinking only spirits. You suspect he has taken MDMA (ecstasy). Which harm-reduction measure is MOST appropriate?

A) Encourage him to keep dancing to "sweat it out"
B) Encourage him to take regular small amounts of water and short cooling breaks
C) Confiscate his chewing gum and send him back to dance
D) Give him strong coffee to keep him awake

Answer: B

---
Q24 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Your venue has a written drugs policy, regular condition-of-entry searches, staff training and good documentation of all drug-related incidents. How can this help the premises licence holder if drugs are found on the premises?

A) It guarantees that nobody will ever use drugs in the venue
B) It supports an "occupier's defence" by showing reasonable steps were taken to prevent drug use
C) It means the Misuse of Drugs Act does not apply inside the venue
D) It allows door supervisors to ignore minor drug use

Answer: B
Explanation: Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is an offence to knowingly permit certain drug activities on premises. A strong, consistently applied drugs policy and good records help show that the licence holder has taken reasonable steps to prevent drug misuse.

---
Q25 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You receive several reports that a man in a black hoodie is dealing drugs in the gents' toilets. When you observe, you see him making brief visits to cubicles with different people, with quick hand-to-hand exchanges. There is currently no police presence. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Enter a cubicle alone and physically search him for drugs
B) Eject him immediately without any record, to avoid paperwork
C) Inform your team and management, monitor him, then safely stop him, refuse entry/eject and seize any drugs found lawfully, while contacting the police
D) Ignore it until the police happen to visit another time

Answer: C
Explanation: Door supervisors should not carry out forced searches, but can work as a team to safely intervene, use condition-of-entry searches, refuse entry or eject, seize any suspected drugs, document the incident and contact the police where dealing is suspected.

---
Q26 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: At 1 a.m., a young woman is found slumped on a sofa. She is extremely unsteady, confused and barely able to stand, but friends say she has had only one drink. A man you do not recognise insists he is "taking her home" and tries to lead her out. What should you do FIRST?

A) Let the man take her home because he seems confident
B) Ask the man for ID and, if over 18, allow them to leave
C) Stop her leaving with him, move her to a safe area and ensure she is supervised while you assess possible spiking and consider medical help
D) Loudly accuse the man of attempted rape in front of everyone

Answer: C
Explanation: Safeguarding is the priority. Someone who may have been spiked should be taken to a safe area, not left alone and not allowed to leave with a stranger. Door staff should monitor her, consider calling an ambulance and inform police and management as appropriate.

---
Q27 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During a search at the door, you find a bag of brightly coloured powders in small packets. The customer says they are "just legal highs from the internet" and demands them back. What is the BEST course of action?

A) Return them because they are sold as "legal highs"
B) Retain, secure and record them, and explain they may be illegal under the Psychoactive Substances Act and will be handed to the police
C) Allow the customer to take them but refuse entry
D) Taste a small amount to see what the powder is

Answer: B
Explanation: While simple possession of psychoactive substances is not generally an offence under the PSA 2016, production and SUPPLY are serious crimes. Door supervisors should seize, secure and record such items under venue policy and hand them to police, as they may be evidence of supply offences or may actually be controlled drugs. Substances marketed as "legal highs" may be illegal psychoactive substances. Door supervisors should never return or sample them; instead they should seize, secure, record and hand them to the police via management.

Q28 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: On the dancefloor, a man collapses. He is very hot to the touch, breathing rapidly, his heart is racing and he suddenly begins to have a seizure. Friends say he has taken "loads of pills" and has been dancing for hours. What is the MOST important action you should take immediately?

A) Move him outside and leave him to cool down on his own
B) Call 999, provide first aid and place him in the recovery position if he is breathing
C) Give him very cold alcoholic drinks to calm him down
D) Wait a few minutes to see if he recovers on his own

Answer: B
Explanation: These are signs of a possible stimulant overdose and medical emergency. You must call 999 at once, ensure his airway is open, place him in the recovery position if he is breathing, and be ready to start CPR if he stops breathing.

---
Q29 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You see two customers openly snorting white powder from a key in a quiet corner. When you alert a colleague, they shrug and say, "We don't bother with that – management don't want the hassle and it keeps the customers happy." What is the BIGGEST risk if this attitude continues?

A) The customers might complain about door staff
B) The venue and licence holder could be accused of knowingly permitting drug use on the premises
C) The music licence will automatically be cancelled
D) The door supervisors will not get paid overtime

Answer: B
Explanation: If staff knowingly ignore drug misuse, the premises licence holder could face action for permitting drug use under the Misuse of Drugs Act and licensing law, potentially risking the venue's licence.

---
Q30 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During a clearly advertised condition-of-entry search, you find a pouch on a customer containing multiple small wraps of white powder, a small digital scale and a roll of £20 notes. What is the MOST appropriate overall response?

A) Return all items if the customer promises not to deal inside
B) Seize and secure the items, record the seizure in detail, refuse entry or eject and contact the police because this strongly suggests dealing
C) Allow the customer to enter but ask them to keep everything hidden
D) Only seize the cash, as the drugs may be fake

Answer: B
Explanation: The combination of multiple wraps, scales and cash strongly indicates dealing. Door supervisors should seize and secure the items, record everything carefully, refuse entry or eject the customer and inform the police.
