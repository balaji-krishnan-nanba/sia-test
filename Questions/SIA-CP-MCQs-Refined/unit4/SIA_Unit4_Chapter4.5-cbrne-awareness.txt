UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.5: RESPONSE TO TERROR INCIDENTS

Question 1 [Easy]
During any terror incident, what is the CPO’s FIRST priority?
A) Ensuring team members are safe
B) Preserving the client’s property
C) Protecting members of the public
D) Ensuring the principal’s safety
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The priority order in any incident is: 1) Principal safety, 2) Team safety, 3) Others, 4) Property. Nothing is more important than the principal’s safety, and every action should support that objective.

Question 2 [Easy]
What is the correct UK guidance sequence when confronted with a firearms or weapons attack?
A) Hide – Run – Tell
B) Run – Hide – Tell
C) Hide – Tell – Run
D) Tell – Run – Hide
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
UK guidance for a weapons attack is “Run – Hide – Tell”: RUN if it is safe to do so, HIDE if you cannot run safely, and TELL the police (999) when it is safe to do so.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which statement best describes the difference between cover and concealment in a firearms attack?
A) Neither cover nor concealment affects your safety
B) Concealment stops bullets; cover just hides you
C) Both cover and concealment stop bullets equally
D) Cover can stop bullets, concealment only hides you
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Cover provides physical protection and can stop bullets (e.g. concrete walls, engine blocks). Concealment only hides you from view (e.g. bushes, curtains) and does not stop bullets.

Question 4 [Easy]
In the context of Run–Hide–Tell, what is the MOST appropriate action during the “TELL” stage once you and the principal are safe?
A) Call the principal’s family to reassure them
B) Start filming the scene for evidence
C) Call 999 and give clear details of the attack and location
D) Post details of the attack on social media
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The “TELL” phase means contacting 999 when safe and providing clear information: location, what is happening, number and description of attackers, weapons seen, direction of travel, and any casualties.

Question 5 [Easy]
During a deliberate vehicle attack directed towards a crowd including your principal, what is generally the safest direction to move them?
A) Towards the vehicle to get its number plate
B) Along the pavement in the direction the crowd is already running
C) Directly away in the same direction the vehicle is travelling
D) Perpendicular to the vehicle’s path and towards solid cover
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
In a vehicle attack, the safest movement is usually perpendicular to the vehicle’s path, getting off the line of attack and towards solid cover such as bollards, walls or substantial structures.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which situation MOST clearly requires an immediate emergency evacuation rather than a planned, orderly exit?
A) A fire breaks out in the building and smoke is entering the area you are in
B) The hotel announces that a test of the alarm system will take place later
C) The venue manager says the event will end 10 minutes early
D) The principal wants to leave before the traffic gets heavy
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
An emergency evacuation is required when there is an immediate threat to life, such as fire, explosion or active attack. Smoke entering the area indicates a direct, urgent danger.

Question 7 [Easy]
Once the immediate threat has passed and you have reached a place of safety, what should a CPO do FIRST?
A) Start giving a media statement if reporters are present
B) Begin writing a full incident report
C) Return to the scene to assess property damage
D) Check the principal’s physical and emotional condition
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Even post-incident, the principal remains the first priority. The CPO should immediately check the principal’s physical and emotional state and ensure they remain secure before anything else.

Question 8 [Medium]
During a firearms attack in a shopping centre, your principal is next to you, a teammate is on the other side of the concourse, and the principal’s briefcase with important documents is left behind. Gunfire is getting closer. What should you do FIRST?
A) Retrieve the briefcase so sensitive documents are not lost
B) Tell the principal to stay where they are while you go to help members of the public
C) Run towards your teammate to regroup the team
D) Move the principal immediately towards the safest available cover and evacuation route
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The principal’s safety overrides team, public and property. The correct action is to move the principal immediately towards cover and a safe route away from the threat.

Question 9 [Medium]
You are with your principal in a hotel lobby when you hear what sounds like gunfire from the restaurant area. The main exit is clear and leads away from the noise. According to Run–Hide–Tell and your CPO duties, what is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Approach the restaurant to see what is happening
B) Move the principal into a small side office and lock the door
C) Wait to confirm that the noise is definitely gunfire before moving
D) Immediately move the principal out through the exit and away from the building
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
When it is safe to do so, the first priority in Run–Hide–Tell is to RUN. With a clear exit leading away from the suspected attack, the best option is to evacuate the principal immediately.

Question 10 [Medium]
During a firearms attack in a car park, you must choose the BEST available cover for your principal. Which option offers the most effective ballistic protection?
A) Positioning behind the engine block of a parked vehicle
B) Lying flat behind a hedge at the edge of the car park
C) Hiding behind a parked car door
D) Crouching behind a glass bus shelter
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The engine block of a vehicle is one of the best pieces of available cover in a car park, as it is dense enough to help stop bullets. Car doors, glass and hedges offer little or no real ballistic protection.

Question 11 [Medium]
An explosion occurs outside a venue as your principal is leaving. There is dust and debris but no obvious injuries to your team. What is your PRIMARY concern in the seconds immediately after moving the principal away from the blast area?
A) Returning to the blast site to help casualties
B) Taking photographs of the scene to assist the later investigation
C) Moving further away from the area and remaining alert for possible secondary devices
D) Collecting the principal’s belongings left near the entrance
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Terrorist tactics often involve secondary devices targeting responders or crowds after the initial blast. Once the principal is moved away from the immediate area, you must increase distance further and remain alert for additional devices.

Question 12 [Medium]
You are evacuating a principal from a conference centre following reports of a possible IED inside the building. Which route is MOST appropriate?
A) Via the underground car park directly beneath the conference hall
B) Using a side exit that leads away from the reported device and avoids large crowds
C) Through the main foyer, which is crowded but closest to the car park
D) Past a glass-fronted atrium facing the reported device location
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Evacuation routes should lead away from the threat, avoid known risk areas (e.g. near the reported device, glass frontages, underground areas) and reduce exposure to crowds and bottlenecks.

Question 13 [Medium]
You and your principal are sheltering behind solid cover when armed police enter the area with weapons drawn. What is the MOST appropriate action for you as the CPO?
A) Reach into your jacket to retrieve your SIA licence to prove who you are
B) Immediately run towards the officers, waving your arms to get their attention
C) Keep your hands clearly visible, follow all verbal instructions, and only identify yourself as a CPO when it is safe to do so
D) Shout detailed directions at the officers about where you think the attackers are
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
When armed police arrive, you may initially be treated as a potential threat. You must comply fully, keep hands visible, avoid sudden movements and only explain your role or produce ID when told it is safe.

Question 14 [Medium]
Several hours after a terror incident, you and the principal are in a secure location and emergency services have control of the scene. Which action is MOST appropriate as part of your professional post-incident responsibilities?
A) Discarding any written notes taken during the incident to protect client confidentiality
B) Posting your account of the incident on social media to correct rumours
C) Immediately resuming normal itinerary to show that operations are unaffected
D) Making contemporaneous notes of events, decisions and actions to support any formal statement or debrief
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Accurate, contemporaneous notes provide an important record for legal protection, investigations and learning. They should be factual and objective, and support later statements and debriefs.

Question 15 [Hard]
You are escorting a principal through a busy train station. You hear two sharp bangs from the concourse, people begin screaming and running, and you briefly see a person holding what appears to be a firearm. According to the OODA loop and incident priorities, which sequence of actions BEST demonstrates an effective response?
A) Act immediately by running to the suspect to disarm them, orient once you reach them, then decide what to do with the principal
B) Orient by asking members of the public what is happening, decide whether it is serious, act if confirmed, then observe how the situation develops
C) Decide to film the suspect, observe more carefully, act if they move towards you, then orient the team
D) Observe the emerging threat, orient by quickly identifying a safe direction and cover, decide on an evacuation route, then act by moving the principal rapidly towards that cover and exit
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The OODA loop is Observe – Orient – Decide – Act. In this context, that means noticing the threat, understanding where safety lies, choosing a route, then acting immediately to move the principal towards cover and away from danger.

Question 16 [Hard]
You and your principal are on the third floor of an office building when confirmed reports come in of an active firearms attacker in the ground-floor reception area. You can hear sporadic gunfire below. The main stairwell exits through reception. A secondary stairwell leads to a rooftop door that you can lock behind you. According to Run–Hide–Tell principles, what is the BEST immediate option?
A) Lead the principal down the main stairwell to reach the car as quickly as possible
B) Stay in the corridor, listening for more information before moving
C) Take the principal via the secondary stairwell, secure the rooftop door, and remain out of sight while preparing to call 999
D) Move the principal back into their office and hide under the desk
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
With the attacker between you and the main exit, it is not safe to run that route. The best option is to move to a secure hiding place (cover/concealment), lock or barricade, stay out of sight and then TELL by calling 999 when safe.

Question 17 [Hard]
In a hotel foyer, you are positioned between your principal and a man who suddenly produces a large knife and begins moving aggressively towards the crowd. The main exit is behind the attacker, but a service corridor to your left leads to a secure kitchen area with lockable doors. What is the MOST appropriate response?
A) Stand still in front of the principal, shouting verbal commands at the attacker in the hope they will back down
B) Move the principal quickly into the service corridor, using furniture or obstacles to create distance and barriers between them and the attacker
C) Step forward to physically engage and disarm the attacker while instructing the principal to stay where they are
D) Escort the principal towards the main exit, passing as close as possible to the attacker to reach the vehicle outside
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
With an edged weapon, distance and barriers are key. Moving the principal away using a safer side route and placing solid obstacles between them and the attacker is preferable to closing distance or moving past the threat.

Question 18 [Hard]
The day after a serious terror incident in which your principal was uninjured but shaken, you are back at a secure residence. Police have already taken initial statements. From a professional close protection perspective, which combination of actions is MOST appropriate?
A) Focus solely on resuming full operational tempo to demonstrate resilience and avoid any changes to procedures
B) Delay any formal debrief until several months have passed, so that memories are no longer emotional
C) Avoid discussing the incident with the principal or team so that everyone can “put it behind them” quickly
D) Participate in a structured debrief to identify lessons learned, support colleagues’ welfare, and ensure the principal has access to any necessary psychological support
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Post-incident, a CPO should support a formal debrief to capture lessons learned, update training and procedures, and also recognise and manage the psychological impact on the principal and team, including professional support if needed.
