THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE UNIT
--------
Unit 6: Physical Intervention Skills for Close Protection
- Assessment: Practical assessment
- Chapters: 5
- Practice Questions: 111 total
- This chapter (6.1) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 6

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Physical intervention in Close Protection differs fundamentally from door
supervision. The CPO's PRIMARY purpose is ALWAYS to protect the principal,
not to restrain or control the attacker. Understanding when and how to use
physical intervention - and when NOT to - is essential for effective
protection.

================================================================================
CHAPTER 6.1: PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL INTERVENTION FOR CPOs - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 22
- Easy (direct recall): 9 questions
- Medium (application): 9 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.1.1: PHYSICAL INTERVENTION IN CLOSE PROTECTION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CP vs Door Supervision Physical Intervention:

DOOR SUPERVISION PI:
- Control the aggressor
- Restrain if necessary
- Ejection focused
- Stay at venue
- Aggressor is focus

CLOSE PROTECTION PI:
- Protect the principal
- Create distance/time
- Evacuation focused
- Leave if necessary
- Principal is focus

The Fundamental Difference:
- CPO goal = Principal safety, NOT controlling aggressor
- "Win" = Principal is safe, not aggressor subdued
- Withdrawal often better than engagement
- Engagement only to enable principal evacuation

When Physical Intervention May Be Needed:

TO PROTECT PRINCIPAL:
- Direct attack on principal
- Creating space to evacuate
- Blocking attacker's path
- Shield and move

TO PROTECT SELF:
- Direct attack on CPO
- Self-defence
- Enabling continued protection
- Survival

TO PROTECT OTHERS:
- Third party in danger
- Duty of care situations
- If doesn't compromise principal safety

Priority Order:
1. Principal safety (ALWAYS FIRST)
2. Team safety
3. Others' safety
4. Property (LOWEST)

Key Principle:
"Cover and Evacuate" - get between threat and principal, move principal away

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.1.2: LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal Basis for Use of Force:

SELF-DEFENCE (Common Law):
- Defence of yourself
- Defence of another person (principal)
- Pre-emptive strike allowed if attack imminent
- Based on honest belief

CRIMINAL LAW ACT 1967 SECTION 3:
- Prevention of crime
- Effecting lawful arrest
- Reasonable force only

Key Legal Principles:

NECESSITY:
- Force must be necessary
- No other option available
- Cannot avoid situation

PROPORTIONALITY:
- Force matches threat
- Not excessive
- Reasonable in circumstances

HONEST BELIEF:
- Based on what you genuinely believed
- Not judged with hindsight
- Mistaken belief can still be lawful
- If honest and genuine

Pre-Emptive Action:
- Legal if attack imminent
- Don't have to wait to be hit
- Based on honest belief
- Must still be proportionate

What the Law Requires:

YOU MUST:
- Use minimum force necessary
- Stop when threat stops
- Act on honest belief
- Be able to justify actions

YOU MUST NOT:
- Use excessive force
- Continue after threat ended
- Use force as punishment
- Act in revenge

Consequences of Unlawful Force:
- Criminal prosecution (assault, GBH)
- Civil liability (damages)
- SIA licence revocation
- Employment termination
- Professional reputation damage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.1.3: DECISION MAKING FOR PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Decision Process:

ASSESS:
- What is the threat?
- To whom?
- How immediate?
- What are my options?

CONSIDER:
- Can I avoid physical intervention?
- What's the minimum needed?
- What are the risks?
- What's best for principal?

DECIDE:
- Act or don't act
- What level of response
- Commit to decision

ACT:
- Execute decision
- Monitor effect
- Adjust as needed

REVIEW:
- Is it working?
- De-escalate when possible
- Stop when threat neutralised

Factors Affecting Decision:

THREAT FACTORS:
- Number of attackers
- Weapons present
- Size and capability
- Determination/intent

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS:
- Space available
- Escape routes
- Obstacles
- Other people present

PRINCIPAL FACTORS:
- Physical condition
- Compliance likely
- Health considerations
- Panic response

CPO/TEAM FACTORS:
- Numbers available
- Training level
- Physical condition

   - No action needed

2. VERBAL:
   - Commands
   - Warnings
   - De-escalation

3. TACTICAL POSITIONING:

   - Cover

4. PHYSICAL CONTROL:
   - Holds
   - Escorts
   - Blocks

5. DEFENSIVE TACTICS:
   - Strikes
   - Takedowns
   - Force to protect

Avoid if Possible:
- Physical intervention is last resort
- Other options first
- If principal can be evacuated without PI, do so
- Risk assessment always

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.1.4: COVER AND EVACUATE PRINCIPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Cover and Evacuate:
- Core CP physical response
- Get between threat and principal
- Move principal to safety
- Maintain cover throughout

The Process:

1. IDENTIFY THREAT:
   - Recognise danger
   - Direction of threat
   - Type of threat

2. COVER:
   - Position between threat and principal
   - Body as shield if necessary
   - Block attacker's path

3. EVACUATE:
   - Move principal away
   - Pre-planned direction if possible
   - Away from threat
   - To safety

4. MAINTAIN:
   - Keep cover throughout movement
   - Continuous protection
   - Team coordination

Cover Techniques:

BODY POSITIONING:
- Side-on to threat
- Principal behind you
- Arms ready to block/deflect
- Mobile, not static

MOVEMENT WITH PRINCIPAL:
- Guide principal's movement
- Clear commands
- Physical guidance if needed
- Coordinated movement

Team Cover and Evacuate:

ROLES:
- One or more engage/delay threat
- Others evacuate principal
- Communication essential
- Pre-trained responses

COORDINATION:
- Verbal commands
- Non-verbal signals
- Trained drills
- Automatic responses

When Cover and Evacuate Not Possible:
- Multiple directions of threat
- No escape route
- Principal cannot move
- Then: protect in place, fight if necessary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.1.5: ATTACK THE ATTACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is "Attack the Attack":
- Moving toward threat
- Intercepting attacker
- Creating space for principal evacuation

- Follow through

OBJECTIVE:
- Create space and time
- Not necessarily to subdue
- Enable principal evacuation
- Disengage when possible

Techniques:
- Interception
- Blocking
- Strikes if necessary
- Control if possible

After Attack the Attack:
- Maintain awareness
- Secondary threats possible
- Rejoin principal when safe
- Team communication

UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.1: PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL INTERVENTION FOR CPOs
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the PRIMARY difference between physical intervention in Close 
Protection compared to door supervision?

A) CPOs can use more force
B) CPOs focus on protecting the principal, not controlling the aggressor
C) Door supervisors cannot use physical intervention
D) CPOs must always engage attackers

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The fundamental difference is that CPOs focus on protecting 
the principal, not on controlling or restraining the aggressor. In door 
supervision, the goal is often to control and eject. In CP, the goal is 
principal safety - which often means evacuation rather than engagement. 
"Winning" means the principal is safe, not that the aggressor is subdued.
