UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.5: POST-INCIDENT PROCEDURES FOR PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the FIRST priority in the immediate post-incident sequence?

A) Documentation
B) Securing the scene and ensuring the threat is neutralised
C) Calling the client
D) Debriefing the team

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The first priority after physical intervention is to SECURE 
the scene - ensuring the threat is neutralised, the principal is safe, 
and there are no secondary threats. Only once the scene is secure can 
other priorities like medical assistance, communication, and evidence 
preservation be addressed.
