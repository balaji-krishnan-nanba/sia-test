UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.4: COMMUNICATION IN CONFLICT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
According to communication research, what percentage of a message is 
conveyed through BODY LANGUAGE?

A) 7%
B) 38%
C) 55%
D) 93%

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Research suggests that approximately 55% of communication is 
conveyed through body language, 38% through tone of voice, and only 7% 
through the actual words spoken. This is why non-verbal communication is 
so important in conflict situations - what you show matters more than 
what you say.
