UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.3: PROBLEM-SOLVING TECHNIQUES FOR RESOLVING CONFLICT

Question 1 [Easy]
In the WIN model of conflict resolution, what does the 'I' step focus on?
A) Identifying what solution you prefer
B) Issuing clear instructions immediately
C) Understanding the impact of the problem on the person
D) Insisting that the person follows the rules
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
In the WIN model, ‘I’ stands for Impact – how the situation is affecting the person. Asking about and recognising the impact shows empathy and helps you understand why the issue matters to them, before moving on to their needs.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which of the following is a key part of active listening when dealing with a complaint?
A) Avoiding eye contact so they don’t feel watched
B) Quickly offering solutions before they finish speaking
C) Thinking about your next response while they are talking
D) Focusing fully on the speaker and not interrupting
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Active listening means giving the person your full attention, not interrupting, and showing you are listening. This helps you understand the real issue and makes the person feel heard and respected.

Question 3 [Easy]
Why is offering choices often helpful in conflict situations?
A) It proves the officer is willing to ignore company policies
B) It gives the person some control and makes cooperation more likely
C) It allows the security officer to avoid making any decisions
D) It shows the person they must obey immediately
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Offering choices gives the person a sense of control, reduces feelings of powerlessness and makes them more likely to cooperate. Both options should be acceptable to you as the officer.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which list shows the steps of the WIN model in the correct order?
A) Impact – What – Needs
B) What – Needs – Impact
C) Needs – Impact – What
D) What – Impact – Needs
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The WIN model follows the order: W – What is their problem?, I – Impact on them, N – Needs: what they need from you. This structure helps you understand the situation before moving to solutions.

Question 5 [Easy]
A shopper in a retail centre complains that they have queued in the wrong line and politely asks to be served at your desk instead. Allowing this is within site rules. According to a problem-solving approach, what is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Tell them to complain to head office instead
B) Give them what they want because it is reasonable and allowed
C) Ignore the request and call the next person in the queue
D) Refuse and tell them that “rules are rules”
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
If what they want is reasonable, safe and within your authority, the simplest solution is to give it. This resolves the conflict quickly and shows flexible, customer-focused problem-solving.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which of the following should NOT be negotiated by a security officer?
A) Agreeing a time later in the day for someone to return
B) How long someone might wait to see a manager
C) Allowing someone to ignore safety requirements
D) Whether a delivery can be redirected to a different bay
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Law, regulations and safety requirements are not negotiable. You can negotiate on time, process, and practical arrangements, but not on anything that would compromise safety or break rules.

Question 7 [Easy]
Which statement is the best example of setting a clear professional boundary?
A) “If you weren’t so rude, we wouldn’t have this issue.”
B) “I’m happy to help, but I need you to lower your voice.”
C) “Stop it right now or else.”
D) “Fine, do whatever you want, it’s not my problem.”
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A clear boundary is specific, respectful and linked to acceptable behaviour. It says what you need from them while still offering help. Aggressive or sarcastic comments damage communication and escalate conflict.

Question 8 [Easy]
Which situation shows that problem-solving is no longer working and another approach may be needed?
A) The person calms down after you listen to their complaint
B) The person becomes increasingly aggressive and makes threats despite your efforts
C) The person asks politely to speak to the manager
D) The person asks for some time alone to think
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
If, despite your problem-solving efforts, the person becomes more aggressive and starts making threats, this suggests problem-solving has failed. Safety becomes the priority and you may need to withdraw, get backup or call the police.

Question 9 [Medium]
A contractor complains about an unexpected parking charge at a corporate site. The security officer immediately says, “I can’t change the rules; you’ll have to pay the full amount.” According to the WIN model, what should the officer have done FIRST?
A) Told the contractor that if they don’t pay, the car will be clamped
B) Asked the contractor what solution they expect from the company
C) Explained how the charge affects the officer’s own duties
D) Listened to understand exactly what the contractor’s problem is
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The first step in WIN is What – understanding their problem or concern. The officer should listen and explore what the issue really is before explaining rules or discussing solutions.

Question 10 [Medium]
In an office building, a staff member becomes angry when you ask to search their bag as they leave, saying, “You never do this to managers. You’re picking on me.” What is the MOST likely underlying issue you need to understand?
A) They are hoping to be dismissed from their job
B) They are frightened of security equipment
C) They feel disrespected and treated unfairly
D) They want to avoid leaving the building
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The comments about managers and “picking on me” suggest a feeling of disrespect and unfairness, not just the bag search itself. Recognising this underlying concern helps you respond with empathy and fairness.

Question 11 [Medium]
After resolving a complaint at a warehouse gate, you agree to email your control room and ensure the visitor receives an update the next day. According to good follow-through practice, what should you do next?
A) Do nothing now because the visitor has already left the site
B) Assume someone else will remember and deal with it later
C) Record what was agreed and make sure the promised actions are carried out
D) Wait to see if the visitor contacts you again
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Follow-through is vital for credibility. You should record what was agreed and actively ensure the promised actions are taken. Failing to do so can create further complaints and damage trust.

Question 12 [Medium]
Which of the following is the BEST example of offering a positive choice?
A) “Leave now or I’ll call the police.”
B) “You can wait here in reception or in the café while I check with my supervisor.”
C) “If you don’t cooperate, you’ll be banned from site.”
D) “Either calm down or I’ll have you removed from the building.”
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Positive choices give the person two acceptable options and some control, without threats. Both locations are acceptable to you, and the choice may reduce tension while you check the situation.

Question 13 [Medium]
A visitor is upset about a delay at reception. You say, “I can see this has made you late for your meeting and that’s really frustrating for you.” Which part of the WIN model does this statement show?
A) Impact
B) Needs
C) Negotiation
D) What
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
You are recognising how the situation is affecting them – being late and feeling frustrated. This is the Impact step, showing empathy and that you understand why it matters to them.

Question 14 [Medium]
A customer in a retail store is angry about a refund and is raising their voice at the till. You want to help them calm down without embarrassing them in front of others. Which response best offers a face‑saving choice?
A) “If you don’t quieten down, I’ll remove you from the store.”
B) “Stop shouting, you’re making a scene.”
C) “Perhaps you’d like to step to one side so we can talk about this more calmly?”
D) “If you calm down now, I might help you.”
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
A face-saving choice allows them to calm down without losing dignity. Inviting them to one side gives privacy and a way to change their behaviour without public embarrassment.

Question 15 [Medium]
At an industrial site, a delivery driver insists on unloading immediately in a restricted area. You cannot allow this on safety grounds, but there is some flexibility about timing and process. Which option is the BEST example of negotiation and compromise?
A) Allow the driver to unload in the restricted area this once
B) Refuse to discuss it and tell the driver to leave the site
C) Explain the restriction and agree they can wait in a safe area while you check if the loading bay will be free in 15 minutes
D) Threaten to report the driver to their employer unless they leave immediately
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Negotiation and compromise involve looking for a solution that respects safety while addressing their needs where possible. Offering a safe waiting area and checking for a later opportunity respects the rules but shows flexibility.

Question 16 [Medium]
In a corporate reception, a visitor is repeatedly swearing at you. You have already said, “I’m happy to help, but I need you to stop using that language.” They continue swearing. What should you do NEXT, in line with setting boundaries and following through?
A) Change the boundary and accept the swearing as long as there are no threats
B) Swear back so they know you are not intimidated
C) Remind them of the boundary and calmly explain you will end the conversation or ask them to leave if it continues, then act if necessary
D) Ignore the language to avoid making things worse
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Boundaries must be clear, consistent and followed through. You should remind them of the boundary, state the consequence, and be prepared to act if they choose not to comply.

Question 17 [Hard]
A member of staff is angry because their access card has stopped working, and they are late for a shift. You decide to use the WIN model to deal with this. Which sequence of actions BEST demonstrates the WIN model in practice?
A) Offer a quick solution; if they refuse, warn them; if they are still angry, walk away
B) Tell them the access rules first; then ask what they need; then ask how they feel about it
C) Ask them to explain what has happened; recognise how it is affecting them; then explore what they need and what you can realistically do
D) Ask how the problem is affecting them; then tell them to calm down; then ask what they want you to do
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
WIN = What, Impact, Needs. First understand what the problem is, then recognise the impact on them, and finally explore their needs and what you can do. Option A follows that structure and supports calm, structured problem-solving.

Question 18 [Hard]
At a corporate reception, a visitor says, “I’ve been standing here ten minutes and no one cares. If I were a director you’d move faster.” After you apologise and acknowledge their frustration, they quickly calm down. Which underlying issue did your response MOST likely address?
A) Their fear of using lifts
B) Their wish to avoid signing in
C) Their feeling of being disrespected or treated unfairly
D) Their need for free parking
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The comments about being treated differently from a director suggest a concern about respect and fairness. By recognising their frustration and apologising, you address that emotional need, not just the delay itself.

Question 19 [Hard]
On an industrial site, a contractor demands immediate access to a high‑risk area but has not completed the required safety induction. Site rules and law say no one may enter without this training. What is the MOST appropriate response?
A) Explain you cannot let them in without the induction for safety reasons, empathise with their frustration, and offer to help arrange the induction or a suitable waiting area
B) Argue with them until they give up and leave
C) Allow them in “just this once” to avoid an argument
D) Tell them it’s not your problem and walk away
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
When there is no safe or legal way to give them what they want, you must explain the constraint honestly, show empathy, and offer what you can do (such as arranging the induction or a place to wait), rather than making false promises or breaking rules.

Question 20 [Hard]
In a shopping centre, a man who has refused to leave now picks up a metal display pole and waves it around, shouting that he will “smash the place up.” You are the only security officer present and there are members of the public nearby. You have already tried listening, offering choices and setting boundaries without success. What is the MOST appropriate next step?
A) Move people away to a safe distance, withdraw if needed, and call for urgent backup or police assistance
B) Continue talking to him as if nothing has changed
C) Move in close and try to grab the pole by yourself
D) Ignore him and carry on with your normal patrol
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
When problem-solving fails and violence appears imminent, safety comes first. You should protect yourself and others by creating distance, moving the public away and getting backup/police. Physical intervention is a last resort and should not be attempted alone in a high‑risk situation.
