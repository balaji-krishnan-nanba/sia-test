UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.2: HEALTH, SAFETY AND RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What position carries the HIGHEST risk of positional asphyxia?

A) Recovery position (on side)
B) Seated position
C) Prone position (face down)
D) Standing position

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The prone (face down) position carries the HIGHEST risk of 
positional asphyxia. In this position, body weight can compress the chest 
and restrict breathing, especially if additional weight is applied to the 
back. If restraint in prone position is necessary, it should be for 
minimum time and the person should be moved to recovery position as 
soon as safely possible.
