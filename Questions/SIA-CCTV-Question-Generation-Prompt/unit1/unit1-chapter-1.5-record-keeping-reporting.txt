UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.5: RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What does 'contemporaneous' mean in relation to record keeping?

A) Written by the same person throughout
B) Made at the time or as soon as possible after
C) Containing pictures and diagrams
D) Signed by a witness

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Contemporaneous means made at the time of the event or as soon 
as possible afterwards, while memory is still fresh. This gives records 
greater evidential value as they are less likely to be affected by memory 
degradation or later influences.
