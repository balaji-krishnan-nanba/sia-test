DRUGS AWARENESS AND PROCEDURES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 25 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.7 of 
the SIA Security Guard Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 6-7 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer
- 60 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 90 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (42 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.7) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Drug misuse affects many workplaces and public spaces. Security officers 
must be able to recognise signs of drug use, understand the law, and know 
how to handle situations involving drugs safely and legally. This knowledge 
protects the security officer, the public, and the premises they work at.

NOTE: While security officers typically work in non-licensed premises, they 
may still encounter drug-related issues in retail, corporate, industrial, 
and other environments.
