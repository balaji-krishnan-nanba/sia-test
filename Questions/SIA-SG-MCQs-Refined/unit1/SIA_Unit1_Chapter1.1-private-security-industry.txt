B) Do nothing, as address changes are not important
C) Only tell their employer, not the SIA

A) Only tell their employer at the next appraisal
B) Do nothing unless the police contact the SIA
C) Inform the SIA promptly about the conviction

Answer: D
Explanation: Controlling entry at licensed premises where alcohol is sold is door supervision.

Q38 | Difficulty: Hard
---

A) Only the unlicensed operatives
B) Only the venue owner
C) The unlicensed operatives and their direct employer, with the main contractor and venue also at risk if they knew or should have known
D) No one, because the sub-contractor, not the staff, signed the contract

Answer: C
Explanation: The unlicensed operatives and the company that directly deploys them are committing offences; the main contractor and venue may also face enforcement if they knowingly allowed unlicensed staff to be used.

---
Q40 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: The SIA discovers that a training provider has been falsifying exam results, meaning some licence holders obtained their licences with bogus qualifications. Which action is the SIA MOST likely to take?

A) Imprison the trainer directly without involving the courts
B) Suspend or revoke affected licences and consider prosecutions against those responsible
C) Ignore the issue because licences have already been issued
D) Transfer all affected staff automatically into the ACS scheme

Answer: B

---
Q41 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A Security Guard receives a recent conviction for serious assault but does not tell the SIA. The conviction only comes to light when they apply to renew their licence. Which outcome is MOST likely?

B) The SIA may refuse renewal or revoke the licence due to the offence and the failure to report it
C) No effect, because the conviction was off duty
D) Automatic renewal with no questions asked

B) They may continue working because they applied before expiry
C) They must stop licensable work once the old licence expires until a new one is granted
D) They may work if they are employed in-house rather than by a contractor

Answer: C

---
Question: During an SIA audit of an ACS-approved company, inspectors find poor record-keeping and frequent breaches of licence conditions (for example, staff not displaying licences). Which outcome is MOST likely?

B) The SIA can only remove ACS status and cannot take any other action
C) The issues are purely for awarding organisations to deal with
