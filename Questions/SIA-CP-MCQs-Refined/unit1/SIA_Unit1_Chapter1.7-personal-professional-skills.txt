UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.7: PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

Question 1 [Easy]
A CPO's duty of confidentiality regarding principal information continues...

A) Until the assignment ends
B) Until the contract expires
C) For five years after employment
D) Indefinitely

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Confidentiality is a lifelong obligation. A CPO must never disclose information about principals, even after an assignment or employment has ended. This includes avoiding books, media interviews, or casual conversations about clients. Professional reputation and trust in the industry depend on maintaining confidentiality indefinitely.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which of the following is the MOST appropriate use of social media by a CPO during an ongoing assignment?

A) Avoiding any reference to work, the principal, or locations on all social media
B) Posting photos from venues as long as the principal is not visible
C) Sharing “behind the scenes” stories but omitting the principal’s name
D) Accepting follower requests from fans of the principal

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: CPOs should not post anything about work, the principal, movements or locations on social media. Even vague or anonymous posts can reveal patterns or details. The safest professional standard is to avoid all work-related content online.

Question 3 [Easy]
When meeting a principal for the first time, which aspect of personal presentation is MOST important?

A) Wearing tactical clothing to show you are ready for action
B) Dressing in clean, smart, professional clothing appropriate to the environment
C) Wearing strong aftershave or perfume to make a strong impression
D) Displaying as much visible equipment as possible to look “professional”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: First impressions matter. A CPO should appear smart, clean and professional, dressed appropriately for the client and environment. Overly tactical clothing, heavy scents and excessive visible kit can be inappropriate and unprofessional.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which behaviour BEST demonstrates active listening when a principal is explaining their concerns?

A) Planning your reply while they are speaking
B) Interrupting to correct details you think are wrong
C) Asking clarifying questions and reflecting back what you have heard
D) Looking around the room to monitor others while they speak

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Active listening involves giving full attention, not interrupting, asking clarifying questions and reflecting back key points to show understanding. This builds trust and ensures the CPO properly understands the principal’s requirements and concerns.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which component of physical fitness is MOST important for coping with long periods of standing, foot patrols and the need to run suddenly if required?

A) Cardiovascular endurance
B) Ability to lift maximum weight once
C) Extreme flexibility in the upper body only
D) Very low body fat percentage

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Cardiovascular endurance allows a CPO to walk, stand and run for sustained periods without excessive fatigue. Strength, flexibility and body composition matter too, but endurance is critical for long hours and sudden physical demands.

Question 6 [Medium]
A principal wants to walk unaccompanied through a public area against your advice. What is the MOST professional first step for the CPO?

A) Refuse and threaten to leave the assignment if they insist
B) Listen to their concerns, explain the risks, and propose safer alternatives
C) Allow them to do as they wish and make no further comment
D) Raise your voice to show how serious the situation is

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When a principal disagrees, the CPO should listen, explain the security reasoning, and offer realistic alternatives. The principal ultimately decides, but good liaison involves diplomacy, clear communication and seeking solutions rather than confrontation.

Question 7 [Medium]
Two members of the CP team strongly disagree about positioning during an event and start arguing immediately before the principal arrives. As a team member, what is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Let them argue in front of the principal so the principal can decide
B) Post about the disagreement in a team WhatsApp group after the event
C) Encourage them to pause the argument and refer the issue up the chain of command
D) Ignore the disagreement and hope it does not affect the operation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Internal conflict must be handled professionally and away from the principal. The correct approach is to stop open disagreement, refer issues through the chain of command, and keep the focus on safe, coordinated protection.

Question 8 [Medium]
You are due to deploy with an international principal to a country whose customs you do not know. What is the BEST approach to cultural awareness?

A) Rely on what you have seen in films and television about the country
B) Assume people will accept British behaviour because you are a guest
C) Wait until you arrive and copy whatever the principal does
D) Research local laws, religious practices and social customs, and seek advice if unsure

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Cultural awareness requires preparation. A professional CPO researches local laws, religious practices, social customs and communication styles before arrival, and asks local contacts or the principal’s staff when unsure. This helps avoid offence and supports effective protection.

Question 9 [Easy]
Which of the following BEST helps a CPO build rapport with the principal’s PA (Personal Assistant)?

A) Being reliable and consistent in following agreed procedures and timings
B) Asking the PA for personal gossip about the principal
C) Inviting the PA out drinking after every shift
D) Complaining to the PA about the workload

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rapport with the client’s staff is built through professionalism: reliability, consistency, respect and clear communication. Over-familiarity, gossip and complaints damage trust and can harm the working relationship.

Question 10 [Easy]
At a large public event, uniformed police are present. How should a CPO normally approach working with them?

A) Give instructions to police officers because the principal is your responsibility
B) Cooperate with them, share relevant information and respect their authority
C) Avoid all contact so the operation remains “low profile”
D) Tell the principal to ignore police instructions as you are in charge of security

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Working with police requires cooperation and mutual respect. The CPO shares relevant information, follows lawful instructions and recognises police authority while still focusing on the principal’s security.

Question 11 [Easy]
Which statement about a CPO’s equipment and kit is MOST accurate?

A) It only needs to be checked on high‑risk operations
B) It is acceptable to borrow random items from others if you forget something
C) It should be clean, functional, organised and readily accessible at all times
D) It should be as large and obvious as possible to deter threats

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Professional presentation includes equipment. Kit must be well maintained, clean, organised and immediately accessible. This supports effective response and reinforces a competent, professional image.

Question 12 [Medium]
You strongly recommend using an armoured vehicle due to a credible threat, but the principal insists on using their usual car. You have explained the risks and suggested alternatives, but they still refuse. What should you do NEXT?

A) Cancel the move without further discussion
B) Agree with the principal and pretend the threat assessment was wrong
C) Withdraw from the operation immediately without explanation
D) Record that you advised against the decision, adjust the plan as safely as possible, and continue professionally

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The principal has the final say, but the CPO must manage expectations and protect themselves professionally. After clearly explaining risks and proposing alternatives, the CPO should document their advice, note the principal’s decision, and adapt the plan to provide the best protection under the chosen option.

Question 13 [Medium]
Which statement BEST describes a Non‑Disclosure Agreement (NDA) commonly signed by CPOs?

A) It is a legally binding document that usually applies during and after employment
B) It is mainly a formality and cannot be enforced in practice
C) It only covers information about the principal’s finances
D) It means you can discuss the principal if you do not use their name

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: NDAs are legally binding and normally cover information during and after employment. They protect the principal’s personal, family, financial and operational details. Breaching an NDA can have serious legal and professional consequences.

Question 14 [Medium]
A CPO has been working long hours. They notice they are more irritable, sleeping poorly and finding it harder to concentrate during briefings. What is the BEST interpretation of these signs?

A) Normal effects of the job that should be ignored
B) Possible symptoms of stress that should be recognised and managed
C) A sign they are not suited to close protection and must leave the industry
D) Evidence they should take stronger stimulants to stay alert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Irritability, poor sleep and reduced concentration are common signs of stress. Recognising these early is essential. The CPO should use stress management strategies (rest, fitness, communication, support) and, if needed, seek further help before performance is seriously affected.

Question 15 [Hard]
You are a CPO accompanying a principal to a country with very conservative cultural and religious norms, especially around gender and physical contact. At a formal meeting, a senior local host approaches. What is the MOST appropriate way to manage greetings and interaction?

A) Insist on using your normal handshake approach with everyone to show confidence
B) Avoid eye contact and remain rigidly silent to avoid making mistakes
C) Observe how others greet, allow the host to lead the level of contact, and use a respectful, modest manner
D) Refuse to engage with anyone whose customs you do not fully understand

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Cultural awareness means adapting while staying professional. The CPO should research customs beforehand, then observe and let others lead in greetings, maintaining respectful body language and modest behaviour. This avoids offence and supports the principal’s relationships.

Question 16 [Hard]
A highly experienced CPO in their mid‑50s is offered a role that will involve long foot patrols, running with equipment and frequent stairs. Recently, they have let their training slip and tire easily. What is the MOST professional course of action?

A) Accept the role and hope experience will compensate for fitness issues
B) Decline immediately because age alone makes the role unsuitable
C) Hide the fitness issues from the employer to secure the job
D) Honestly assess and improve their fitness, and only accept roles they can safely perform to the required standard

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Age is less important than actual fitness and capability. CPOs must honestly assess their physical condition, maintain appropriate training and only accept roles they can perform safely and effectively. Experience is valuable, but it does not replace physical readiness.

Question 17 [Medium]
Over time, a principal begins inviting you to join their family for social activities on your days off and talks about “being friends now”. What is the MOST appropriate response?

A) Maintain clear professional boundaries, politely decline social invitations off‑duty, and keep the relationship professional
B) Accept all invitations to deepen the personal relationship and gain more influence
C) Use the opportunity to discuss other clients and compare their lifestyles
D) Agree to be a friend but reduce your security responsibilities

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The CPO–principal relationship must remain professional. Becoming a social friend risks blurred boundaries, conflicts of interest and reduced objectivity. Professional distance protects both the client and the operative.

Question 18 [Medium]
A CPO has been under pressure for months. They are drinking heavily to sleep, arguing with their partner, and have recently made minor mistakes on shift. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Keep quiet and rely on alcohol to cope with stress
B) Seek help through management, occupational health or counselling services, and discuss workload and support
C) Wait until a serious incident occurs before asking for help
D) Resign immediately without talking to anyone

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: These are serious signs that stress is affecting performance and personal life. The CPO should seek support early—through colleagues, management, occupational health or professional counselling—and address coping strategies and workload before safety is compromised.

Question 19 [Hard]
Heavy traffic causes a delay, and the principal angrily blames you in front of others, saying, “This is your fault. You are wasting my time.” You chose the route based on earlier information. What is the MOST appropriate response?

A) Argue back and explain loudly that it is not your fault
B) Ignore the principal and say nothing
C) Stay calm, acknowledge their frustration, briefly explain the situation, and outline how you will minimise delays
D) Immediately apologise and promise to ignore safety considerations next time to be faster

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Emotional intelligence and diplomacy are vital. The CPO should not argue or become defensive. A professional response recognises the principal’s frustration, calmly explains relevant facts and focuses on solutions and maintaining the relationship.

Question 20 [Hard]
A former colleague, now working for the media, calls you and casually asks for details of your current principal’s schedule for “background” on a story. What should you do?

A) Give only general information, as long as you avoid exact times
B) Share information because the colleague used to be in the same industry
C) Ask them not to quote you by name, then provide the details
D) Refuse to provide any information and remind them of your confidentiality obligations

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Operational details, including schedules and movements, are strictly confidential. A CPO must not share this information with anyone, including former colleagues or media. Confidentiality continues indefinitely and covers all principal and operational information.
