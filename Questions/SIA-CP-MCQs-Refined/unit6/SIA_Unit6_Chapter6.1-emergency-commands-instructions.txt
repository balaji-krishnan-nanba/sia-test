UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.1: PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL INTERVENTION FOR CPOs

Question 1 [Easy] – CP vs DS PI
What is the PRIMARY difference between physical intervention in Close
Protection compared to door supervision?
A) CPOs can use more force
B) CPOs focus on protecting the principal, not controlling the aggressor
C) Door supervisors cannot use physical intervention
D) CPOs must always engage attackers
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The fundamental difference is that CPOs focus on protecting
the principal, not on controlling or restraining the aggressor. In door
supervision, the goal is often to control and eject. In CP, the goal is
principal safety – which often means evacuation rather than engagement.
“Winning” means the principal is safe, not that the aggressor is subdued.

Question 2 [Easy] – CP vs DS PI
You are escorting a principal in a busy nightclub. A man suddenly becomes
aggressive and starts pushing towards the principal. Venue security staff are
moving in to deal with him. From a Close Protection perspective, what outcome
would normally be considered a “win”?
A) The aggressor is restrained on the floor by you
B) You trade blows with the aggressor until police arrive
C) The aggressor is ejected while the principal continues drinking at the bar
D) The principal is moved quickly and safely away from the disturbance
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: In CP, the focus is not on “winning the fight” or ejecting the
aggressor but on keeping the principal safe. Safely evacuating the principal
away from the danger is the desired outcome, even if the aggressor is never
physically subdued by you.

Question 3 [Medium] – CP vs DS PI (Application)
In a hotel lobby, a man rushes towards your principal, shouting threats.
Several hotel security officers are already moving to intercept him. As the
CPO immediately beside the principal, what is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Move to shield the principal and evacuate them along a safe route
B) Help hotel security restrain the aggressor on the floor
C) Stand back and observe until the man actually hits the principal
D) Ask the principal to remain seated while you argue with the aggressor
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The CPO’s priority is the principal’s safety. The correct
response is to cover the principal and evacuate, not to join in restraining
the aggressor. Other security staff can focus on the aggressor; your focus is
to create distance and time for the principal.

Question 4 [Easy] – Legal Framework
What does proportionate force mean in the context of UK self-defence law
for CPOs?
A) Using as much force as you think the principal would want
B) Using exactly the same amount of force as the attacker
C) Using no more force than is reasonably needed to deal with the threat
D) Using the highest level of force available to you
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Proportionate force is about using only what is reasonably
necessary in the circumstances, no more. It must not be excessive and must be
linked to the level of threat faced.

Question 5 [Medium] – Legal Framework (Pre‑emptive Action)
A male storms towards your principal with clenched fists, shouting that he is
going to “smash his face in”. You step in and deliver a pre‑emptive palm strike
to stop him. For this action to be LAWFUL, which justification is the
strongest?
A) You honestly believed an attack was imminent and used only the minimum force needed
B) You wanted to teach him a lesson for being disrespectful to your principal
C) You struck him because you are trained in martial arts and wanted to test your skills
D) You thought pre‑emptive strikes are always allowed, whatever the behaviour
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Under UK law, force (including a pre‑emptive strike) can be
lawful if it is necessary, proportionate and based on an honest belief in an
imminent attack. Acting out of anger, ego or punishment is unlawful.

Question 6 [Hard] – Legal Framework (Unlawful Force Scenario)
During an attack on your principal, you deliver a pre‑emptive strike to an
assailant who is about to swing a bottle. He drops the bottle and falls to the
floor, dazed. Which of the following actions is MOST likely to be judged
unlawful?
A) Guiding him away from the principal while monitoring his movements
B) Controlling his arms briefly to make sure he cannot grab the bottle again
C) Releasing him once you are sure he is no longer an immediate threat
D) Kicking him repeatedly in the head while he lies motionless on the floor
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Once the immediate threat has stopped, continuing to use force
— especially serious force such as repeated kicks to the head — is likely to be
seen as excessive and punitive, and therefore unlawful. Lawful force must stop
when the threat stops.

Question 7 [Easy] – Decision Making Process
Which option shows the correct sequence in the decision‑making process for
physical intervention?
A) Decide → Act → Review → Consider → Assess
B) Assess → Consider → Decide → Act → Review
C) Act → Assess → Decide → Consider → Review
D) Consider → Act → Assess → Decide → Review
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The model is: Assess the situation, Consider options
and risks, Decide on a course of action, Act, and then Review to
see if the response should be escalated, maintained or de‑escalated.

Question 8 [Medium] – Decision Making (Avoiding PI)
You are escorting a principal through a shopping centre and notice a noisy
argument developing ahead. There is a clear side exit you can use to bypass
the situation entirely. Which factor should MOST influence your decision to
avoid physical intervention and use the side exit instead?
A) Whether the argument is being recorded on mobile phones
B) Whether you feel confident you could physically defeat the people arguing
C) Whether the principal can be evacuated safely without any physical contact
D) Whether the shop staff are annoyed by the disturbance
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Physical intervention is a last resort. If you can safely
evacuate the principal without getting physically involved, that is usually the
best option. The key consideration is always the principal’s safety, achieved
with the minimum necessary intervention.

Question 9 [Medium] – Cover and Evacuate (Application)
At a public event, you see a man about 10 metres away suddenly draw a knife
and move quickly towards your principal’s position. What is the BEST example
of applying the cover and evacuate principle?
A) Shouting at the knife‑man to drop the weapon while the principal remains seated
B) Running directly at the knife‑man to try to knock him to the floor, leaving the principal behind
C) Ordering the principal to confront the attacker while you call the police
D) Placing yourself between the knife‑man and the principal and moving the principal along a safe escape route
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Cover and evacuate means getting between the threat and the
principal, using your body and positioning as cover, and moving the principal
away to safety. It is not about leaving the principal behind to fight.

Question 10 [Easy] – Cover and Evacuate (Definition)
Which statement BEST describes the cover and evacuate principle in Close
Protection?
A) Positioning yourself between the threat and the principal and moving the principal to safety
B) Remaining with the principal while venue security chase the attacker
C) Restraining the attacker on the ground until police arrive, regardless of the principal’s position
D) Guiding members of the public to safety while the principal waits for you
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Cover and evacuate is the core CP physical response: cover
(inserting yourself between threat and principal) and evacuate (moving the
principal away to safety) while maintaining that protective cover.

Question 11 [Medium] – Team Cover and Evacuate
In a team operation inside a crowded venue, a sudden attack is launched from
the front of the principal’s position. Which team response BEST reflects
effective cover and evacuate?
A) The whole team rushes the attacker, leaving the principal temporarily unattended
B) One or more CPOs delay or intercept the threat while others evacuate the principal along a pre‑planned route
C) The team forms a circle around the attacker and waits for police
D) One CPO escorts the attacker outside while the principal continues socialising
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: In a team, roles should be coordinated: some members engage or
delay the threat, while others focus on evacuating and shielding the principal
along a planned escape route. The principal must remain the priority.

Question 12 [Hard] – Attack the Attack (When to Use)
In which situation would “attack the attack” be the MOST appropriate option
for a CPO?
A) A loud but stationary protester is shouting insults at your principal from 20 metres away with clear escape routes available
B) A drunken guest is complaining about the guest list at a distance, and the principal can easily be moved out through a side door
C) A man with a raised knife is only a few steps away from the principal, and the only escape route passes directly by him
D) A disruptive guest has just been ejected by hotel security and is arguing with them outside the venue
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: “Attack the attack” involves moving towards and intercepting
an active, imminent threat when evacuation alone is not possible or safe. In
option C, the attacker is close with a weapon and blocks the escape route, so
interception to create time and space for evacuation may be necessary.

Question 13 [Easy] – Attack the Attack (Definition)
What does “attack the attack” mean in a Close Protection context?
A) Always trying to knock the attacker unconscious
B) Chasing the attacker after they have left the area
C) Using only verbal skills to calm the attacker
D) Moving towards the attacker to intercept their attack and create space and time to evacuate the principal
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: “Attack the attack” is an offensive‑defensive tactic where the
CPO moves towards the threat to intercept or disrupt it, with the objective of
creating time and space to remove the principal, not necessarily to fully
subdue the attacker.

Question 14 [Medium] – Use of Force Continuum (Levels)
Which of the following is the BEST example of Level 3 – soft techniques on
the use of force continuum?
A) Gently guiding a person away from the principal using an escort hold
B) Giving a clear verbal warning at a normal speaking distance
C) Displaying a weapon (where lawfully carried) to deter an attacker
D) Sweeping a person’s legs to take them to the ground
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Soft techniques involve minimal physical force, such as
guiding, light holds and escorting. Verbal commands are Level 2, while
takedowns and strikes fall into harder levels of force.

Question 15 [Medium] – Use of Force Continuum (Escalation)
An aggressive individual ignores your clear verbal commands and suddenly
grabs your principal’s arm, trying to pull them away. According to the use of
force continuum, what is the MOST appropriate next step?
A) Continue repeating verbal commands only
B) Immediately use lethal force against the aggressor
C) Move to soft physical techniques, such as an escort or release hold, to break the grip and protect the principal
D) Walk away and hope the aggressor lets go
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: When verbal commands fail and there is physical contact with
the principal, it is appropriate to escalate to the minimum level of physical
force necessary — in this case, soft techniques to break the grip and regain
control, not lethal or excessive force.

Question 16 [Easy] – Physiological Effects (Tunnel Vision)
Which term describes the stress effect where a CPO focuses so intensely on the
immediate threat that their peripheral vision is reduced?
A) Auditory exclusion
B) Tunnel vision
C) Time distortion
D) Fine motor enhancement
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Tunnel vision is a common effect of the fight‑or‑flight
response. The CPO may see the main threat clearly but lose awareness of other
dangers in the periphery.

Question 17 [Medium] – Physiological Effects (Training Implications)
Why do many CP physical intervention systems emphasise simple, gross‑motor
techniques rather than complex joint locks for high‑stress situations?
A) Complex techniques are illegal in the UK
B) Simple techniques look more impressive on CCTV
C) Gross‑motor techniques are less likely to leave any injury
D) Fine motor skills tend to deteriorate under high stress and adrenaline
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Under stress, fine motor skills (precise movements) often
deteriorate, while gross‑motor movements are more reliable. Training simple,
gross‑motor techniques makes it more likely the CPO can perform effectively in
a real confrontation.

Question 18 [Hard] – Physiological Effects (Freeze & Stress Inoculation)
During an attempted attack, a normally confident CPO reports that for the
first second or two he “froze”, could not move, and everything felt strangely
slow. Afterwards, he is shaken by this and wants to improve his performance.
Which training approach would MOST effectively reduce the chance of this
happening again?
A) Regular realistic scenario training under pressure (stress inoculation)
B) Reading written incident reports in his own time
C) Avoiding thinking about the incident so it does not worry him
D) Practising only fine‑motor drills in a quiet gym
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Realistic scenario‑based training creates controlled exposure
to stress (stress inoculation), helping the CPO recognise the signs of the
fight‑flight‑freeze response and function through them. This is far more
effective than purely theoretical study or fine‑motor drills.

Question 19 [Easy] – Positional Asphyxia (High‑Risk Position)
Which situation presents the HIGHEST risk of positional asphyxia during a
restraint?
A) Person seated upright with feet flat on the floor and no pressure on the torso
B) Person lying on their back with a small cushion under their head
C) Person face down on the floor with several people applying pressure to their back
D) Person standing but held lightly by one arm
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Positional asphyxia is strongly associated with prone (face
down) positions, especially when weight or pressure is applied to the back or
chest. This can restrict breathing and be fatal.

Question 20 [Medium] – Positional Asphyxia (Prevention)
You and another CPO have helped restrain a violent attacker to protect your
principal. The attacker is now under control and the immediate threat has
passed. What is the MOST important action to reduce the risk of positional
asphyxia?
A) Keep all your body weight on their back so they cannot move
B) Move them from any prone position into a safer position (e.g. recovery position) as soon as it is safe, and monitor their breathing
C) Tighten your grip and continue to increase pressure so they stop struggling
D) Assume that if they stop moving, they are fine and no longer need monitoring
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Once safe, the person should be moved out of any high‑risk
position (especially face down), placed in a recovery or seated position and
closely monitored for normal breathing. Continuing pressure, or ignoring them
when they go limp, greatly increases risk.

Question 21 [Easy] – Medical & Welfare (DR ABC)
After a physical intervention, the area is now safe. An attacker is lying on
the floor and may be unconscious. According to DR ABC, what should you do
NEXT?
A) Immediately check for a pulse and ignore breathing
B) Move them straight into the recovery position without any checks
C) Begin chest compressions immediately
D) Check for a response by talking to them and gently shaking their shoulders
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Once Danger has been dealt with, the next step is
Response — checking if the person is conscious by talking to them and
gently shaking. Only then move on to airway, breathing and circulation steps
as appropriate.

Question 22 [Hard] – Medical & Welfare (Duty of Care Priorities)
An attacker has attempted to stab your principal. Your team has disarmed him.
The principal has a small cut to the arm and is very shaken. The attacker is
on the floor, apparently unconscious and bleeding from the head. You have two
other CPOs with you and the scene is now secure. What is the MOST appropriate
overall response?
A) Move the principal to a secure area with one CPO, while another CPO begins first aid on the attacker and someone calls emergency services
B) Leave the principal alone in a side room while all three CPOs focus on treating the attacker
C) Ignore the attacker completely because he caused the incident and focus only on reassuring the principal
D) Stay in the open area with the principal and attacker, waiting for venue staff to decide what to do
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The principal’s safety and welfare remain the top priority, so
they should be moved to a secure area and supported. However, there is still a
duty of care towards the attacker once he is no longer a threat. First aid and
emergency services must be provided/called as soon as possible, using the team
to cover both needs.
