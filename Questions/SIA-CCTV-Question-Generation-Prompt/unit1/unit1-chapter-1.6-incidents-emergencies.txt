SIA CCTV OPERATOR - UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.6
RECOGNISING AND RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 25 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 1.6 of 
the SIA CCTV Operator (Public Space Surveillance) Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 6-7 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 2 Award for Working as a CCTV Operator (Public Space Surveillance)
- Regulates operators monitoring CCTV in public spaces
- Control room based work
- Town centre schemes, transport hubs, retail environments

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 1: Working in the Private Security Industry
- 40 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 60 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (28 correct answers required)
- This chapter (1.6) is one of 6 chapters in Unit 1

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
CCTV operators are often the first to observe emergencies - fires, medical
emergencies, serious incidents, and potential terrorist attacks. Knowing
how to recognise these situations and coordinate an appropriate response
can save lives. While operators rarely attend scenes, their actions in
alerting and directing responders are critical.

UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.6: RECOGNISING AND RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What are the three elements of the fire triangle?

A) Heat, fuel, and oxygen
B) Smoke, flames, and sparks
C) Wood, paper, and electricity
D) Ignition, growth, and decay

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The fire triangle consists of heat, fuel, and oxygen. These 
three elements must be present for a fire to start and continue burning. 
Removing any one of these elements will extinguish the fire. CCTV operators 
should understand this to recognise fire development on cameras.
