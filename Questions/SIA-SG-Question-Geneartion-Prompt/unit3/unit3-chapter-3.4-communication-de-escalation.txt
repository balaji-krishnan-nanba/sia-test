SIA SECURITY GUARD - UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.4
COMMUNICATION TO DE-ESCALATE CONFLICT
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 20 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 3.4 of 
the SIA Security Guard Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 3: Application of Conflict Management in the Private Security Industry
- 20 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 30 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (14 correct answers required)
- This chapter (3.4) is one of 4 chapters in Unit 3

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Communication is the primary tool for de-escalating conflict. How security 
officers speak, their body language, and their positioning all affect 
whether a situation calms down or escalates. Effective communication can 
prevent the need for physical intervention, protect everyone involved, 
and maintain professional standards.

Give Time:

- Let them process
- "Take a moment if you need to"
- Patience

Apologise Appropriately:

UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.4: COMMUNICATION TO DE-ESCALATE CONFLICT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the recommended angle to position your body when speaking with 
a potentially aggressive person?

B) At a 45-degree angle
C) With your back to them
D) At a 90-degree angle (side-on)

less confrontational than standing square-on, presents a smaller target, 
provides better balance, and allows easier movement while still maintaining 
eye contact and communication.
