UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.7: DRUGS AWARENESS AND PROCEDURES
Question 1 [Easy]
Which piece of legislation creates the Class A, B and C system for controlled drugs in the UK?
A) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
B) Licensing Act 2003
C) Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
D) Psychoactive Substances Act 2016
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is the main UK law that controls dangerous drugs. It creates the Class A, B and C system and sets out the main offences and penalties for controlled drugs.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which of the following is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971?
A) Cannabis
B) Ketamine
C) Heroin
D) Diazepam
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Heroin (diamorphine) is a Class A drug. Cannabis and ketamine are Class B, and diazepam (a benzodiazepine) is a Class C drug.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which drug is normally classified as a Class B drug?
A) Cannabis
B) Heroin
C) GHB
D) LSD
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Cannabis (herbal, resin or oil) is a Class B drug. LSD and heroin are Class A. GHB is now controlled as a Class B drug in the UK due to its role in serious harm and drug‑facilitated offences.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which sign is MOST associated with stimulant use such as cocaine or ecstasy?
A) Strong smell of herbal smoke on clothing
B) Extreme drowsiness and “nodding off”
C) Pinpoint (very small) pupils
D) Dilated (very large) pupils and increased energy
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Stimulants such as cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) typically cause dilated pupils, high energy, rapid speech, sweating and restlessness. Pinpoint pupils and “nodding off” are more associated with opiates like heroin, and a strong herbal smell suggests cannabis.

Question 5 [Easy]
Opiates like heroin typically cause which change in the pupils?
A) Pupils that rapidly change size
B) Constricted/pinpoint pupils
C) No change in pupil size
D) Widely dilated pupils
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Heroin and other opiates are depressants and often cause constricted, “pinpoint” pupils, along with drowsiness, slow breathing and “nodding off”.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which sign is MOST commonly associated with cannabis use?
A) Blue lips and fingertips
B) Frequent nosebleeds and white powder around the nostrils
C) Distinctive strong smell on clothing and breath
D) Track marks on the arms
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Cannabis has a strong, distinctive smell which often clings to clothing and breath. Red eyes, lethargy and “munchies” (increased appetite) are also common. Track marks suggest injecting drugs, and blue lips may indicate a serious medical emergency such as an overdose.

Question 7 [Easy]
If you find a small amount of drugs on a visitor during a search, what should you NEVER do?
A) Record the find in the incident log
B) Contact the police
C) Return the drugs to the person
D) Secure the drugs as evidence
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
You must never return drugs to a person, regardless of the quantity or whether they claim to have a prescription. You should seize, secure, record and arrange to hand the drugs over to the police.

Question 8 [Easy]
Under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which activity is a criminal offence in relation to “legal highs”?
A) Simple possession in the street
B) Drinking alcohol at home
C) Supplying psychoactive substances to another person
D) Smoking tobacco at work
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 makes it an offence to produce, supply or offer to supply psychoactive substances (“legal highs”). Simple possession (outside of custody) is not an offence, but supply can lead to serious penalties.

Question 9 [Easy]
You suffer a needle-stick injury from a discarded needle. What should you do FIRST?
A) Ignore it if the puncture is very small
B) Allow the wound to bleed and then wash it thoroughly with soap and water
C) Immediately suck the wound to remove any blood
D) Put on a plaster and continue your patrol without telling anyone
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
For a needle-stick injury, you should allow the wound to bleed and wash it thoroughly with soap and water. Do not suck the wound. You must also report the incident and seek medical advice, but the immediate first step is proper first aid.

Question 10 [Easy]
Benzodiazepines such as Valium and Xanax are normally classified as which class of controlled drug?
A) Class B
B) Not controlled at all
C) Class C
D) Class A
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, Valium, Xanax) are Class C controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Question 11 [Medium]
During a patrol of office toilets, you see a small mirror on the cistern, traces of white powder and a tightly rolled banknote on the floor. What type of drug use is this MOST likely to indicate?
A) Snorting cocaine or another stimulant
B) Taking benzodiazepine tablets
C) Smoking cannabis
D) Injecting heroin
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
A mirror or flat surface, white powder residue and rolled banknotes are typical paraphernalia for snorting powdered stimulants such as cocaine. Injecting heroin would more likely involve needles, spoons and tourniquets.

Question 12 [Medium]
In a shopping centre, a man is very energetic, talking rapidly, sweating heavily and keeps making short visits to the toilets. Which type of drug is his behaviour MOST consistent with?
A) Cannabis
B) Benzodiazepines
C) Heroin
D) Stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Hyperactivity, rapid speech, excessive sweating and frequent toilet visits are typical signs of stimulant use, especially cocaine. Heroin and benzodiazepines are depressants and usually cause drowsiness and slow speech.

Question 13 [Medium]
On a night shift, you notice a contractor repeatedly “nodding off” while standing, speaking in a slow, slurred way. His pupils are very small and he keeps scratching his arms. Which substance is this MOST likely to indicate?
A) Amphetamines
B) Cannabis
C) Heroin or another opiate
D) Ecstasy (MDMA)
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Extreme drowsiness, “nodding off”, slurred speech, itching and constricted (“pinpoint”) pupils are classic signs of heroin or other opiate use. Heroin is a Class A depressant drug.

Question 14 [Medium]
An employee in a warehouse returns from lunch with red eyes, smells strongly of herbal smoke, is giggling and working very slowly. As a security officer, what is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Ignore it unless they become violent
B) Immediately call 999 and request police attendance
C) Carry out a drugs test yourself
D) Follow company policy by reporting your concerns to a manager or HR
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The signs suggest possible cannabis use. On a workplace site, staff drug issues should be dealt with under company policies. You should record your observations and report them to management or HR, rather than calling 999 immediately or ignoring the issue.

Question 15 [Medium]
While monitoring CCTV in a retail car park, you see one individual staying in the same corner for over an hour. Different people approach briefly, small items and cash appear to be exchanged, and he keeps checking his phone. What is this behaviour MOST likely to indicate?
A) A group of friends sharing cigarettes
B) A lost delivery driver asking for directions
C) Legitimate staff collection of goods
D) Possible drug dealing taking place
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Multiple short meetings, small exchanges of items for cash, frequent phone use and remaining in the same spot are strong indicators of potential drug dealing.

Question 16 [Medium]
During a bag search at the entrance (carried out under a condition of entry), you find a small wrap of white powder the customer admits is cocaine for personal use. What should you do with the substance?
A) Hand it back because it is “only for personal use”
B) Seize it, secure it as evidence and arrange to hand it to the police
C) Flush it down the toilet to get rid of it
D) Put it in your own locker until the end of the shift
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Security officers may seize suspected drugs but must then secure them, record the details and hand them over to the police. Drugs must never be returned, kept personally or destroyed unofficially.

Question 17 [Medium]
Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which of the following offences is normally treated as MORE serious?
A) Simple possession of a Class A drug
B) Being present where drugs are being used
C) Supplying a Class A drug
D) Possession of a small amount of cannabis
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Supply or intent to supply, especially of Class A drugs, carries the heaviest penalties (up to life imprisonment). Simple possession usually attracts lower maximum sentences.

Question 18 [Medium]
Which of the following substances is specifically EXCLUDED from the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016?
A) A bag of herbal smoking mixture designed to get people “high”
B) A synthetic powder bought online for its psychoactive effects
C) A packet labelled “research chemicals – not for human consumption”
D) A cup of coffee
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 excludes alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, medicines and food. A normal cup of coffee (caffeine) is therefore excluded, while products sold to get people “high” are covered.

Question 19 [Medium]
You find a small bag of tablets in a staff changing area with no-one nearby. After seizing the drugs and securing them, what is the NEXT most important step?
A) Leave them on the supervisor’s desk
B) Give them to a colleague to look after
C) Put them in the bin because you don’t know who they belong to
D) Record full details in the incident log, including time, place and who found them
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
After seizing and securing suspected drugs, you must accurately record the details: what was found, where, when, who found it, and any witnesses. This helps maintain a clear chain of evidence for the police.

Question 20 [Medium]
A member of the public collapses in reception. They are unconscious, breathing very slowly, and their lips are turning blue. You suspect an opiate overdose. What should you do?
A) Try to make them walk around to stay awake
B) Move them outside for fresh air and leave them to recover
C) Call 999 immediately and give first aid, including the recovery position or CPR if required
D) Search them thoroughly for drugs
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Suspected drug overdoses are medical emergencies. You must call 999 at once and give appropriate first aid—placing them in the recovery position if they are breathing, or starting CPR if they are not.

Question 21 [Hard]
You are the only security officer on duty at a small industrial site. From a distance you observe what you strongly suspect is drug dealing at the far end of the car park: several quick exchanges between individuals, small packets and cash visible, and one person acting as lookout. There is no immediate risk to life. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Maintain a safe distance while observing, note descriptions and vehicle details, record the incident and contact the police and your control room/management
B) Ignore the activity unless customers complain
C) Run over filming them on your phone and post the footage on social media later
D) Immediately approach the group alone and physically seize any drugs you can see
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Your priority is safety and good observations. You should not confront suspects alone. Observe from a safe distance, record details and follow procedures by informing your control room/management and contacting the police.

Question 22 [Hard]
At a corporate office, a colleague has already seized a suspicious packet of white powder from a visitor and placed it in a sealed bag in the control room without labelling it. Your supervisor asks you to “just fill in the label as if you found it earlier”. What is the MOST appropriate response?
A) Open the bag to check the contents before labelling it yourself
B) Do as asked to avoid conflict; it will not matter who is recorded as finding it
C) Flush the powder away so there is no need for any paperwork
D) Refuse to alter the facts, and instead record accurately when and from whom you took possession of the sealed bag
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Chain of custody must be accurate and truthful. You must not falsify records. You should record when you took possession, from whom, and keep clear documentation for the police.

Question 23 [Hard]
You work as a security officer in an office block where you have repeatedly found evidence of drug use in the same toilet cubicle (foil, syringes, burnt spoons). You have already reported this several times, but management tell you to “stop making a fuss” because they do not want police involved. Under Section 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (permitting premises to be used for drug activity), what is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Confront any suspected drug users alone in the toilets and try to confiscate their drugs
B) Continue to document all incidents, repeat your concerns in writing, and escalate through your company or senior management so that reasonable steps are taken to prevent drug use on the premises
C) Put up your own posters about drugs without telling anyone
D) Stop recording incidents as requested so you do not upset management
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Section 8 means those responsible for premises must not knowingly permit drug use or supply. As security, you must take reasonable steps—continue to record evidence and escalate concerns so the issue is addressed, not ignored.

Question 24 [Hard]
While searching an area behind a shopping centre, you are accidentally pricked by a discarded needle sticking out of a bin bag. After allowing the wound to bleed and washing it with soap and water, what is the MOST appropriate next action?
A) Try to identify and question people who may have left the needle
B) Report the injury immediately, follow company procedures and seek urgent medical advice
C) Keep working but check the wound again at the end of your shift
D) Cover the wound with tape and say nothing to avoid paperwork
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A needle-stick injury is serious. After first aid, you must report it straight away, follow workplace procedures and obtain prompt medical advice to assess the risk of infection.

Question 25 [Hard]
You work as a security officer at a parcel distribution warehouse. A damaged package spills several colourful packets labelled “plant food – not for human consumption”, which other staff say are “legal highs” intended for resale. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Keep one of the packets to show friends and throw the rest away
B) Treat the contents as potentially illegal under the Psychoactive Substances Act, secure them and report immediately so they can be handed to the police
C) Place the items back in the package and send them on without comment
D) Return the items to the sender because simple possession of psychoactive substances is not an offence
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 makes the supply of psychoactive substances an offence. Products sold as “legal highs” for recreational use may be illegal. You should secure them, record the details and ensure they are reported and handed to the police.
