BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 1: Principles of Working as a Close Protection Operative
- 52 multiple choice questions
- 80 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (37 correct answers required)
- This chapter (1.5) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 1

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Attackers conduct surveillance before attacking. If CPOs can detect 
surveillance, they can disrupt attacks at an early stage. Understanding 
surveillance methods allows CPOs to identify when principals are being 
watched and take appropriate countermeasures.

UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.5: SURVEILLANCE AWARENESS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the difference between counter-surveillance and anti-surveillance?

A) Counter-surveillance is illegal, anti-surveillance is legal
B) Counter-surveillance detects watchers, anti-surveillance prevents watching
C) Counter-surveillance is passive, anti-surveillance is active
D) There is no difference, they are the same thing

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Counter-surveillance refers to active measures to DETECT if 
you are being watched (finding the watchers). Anti-surveillance refers to 
measures to PREVENT being watched (making surveillance difficult). Counter 
is about detection; anti is about prevention.

KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

COUNTER vs ANTI SURVEILLANCE:
- Counter-surveillance = DETECTING surveillance (finding watchers)
- Anti-surveillance = PREVENTING surveillance (stopping them watching)

SURVEILLANCE TYPES:
- Static (fixed observation point)
- Mobile (following target)
- Technical (electronic devices)
- Overt (visible) vs Covert (hidden)

SURVEILLANCE DETECTION ROUTE (SDR):
- Pre-planned route
- Includes checkpoints
- Forces surveillance to reveal itself
- Trigger points and chokepoints

SURVEILLANCE INDICATORS:
- Repeated sightings (same person, different places)
- Out of place behaviour
- Following movements
- Communication when target moves
- Vehicles with occupants watching

ANTI-SURVEILLANCE MEASURES:
- Vary routines (UNPREDICTABILITY)
- Change routes
- Alter timings
- Control information

SURVEILLANCE TEAM ROLES:
- Commander (overall control)
- Eyeball (direct observation)
- Backup (ready to take over)
- Trigger (alerts team to movement)

WHEN SURVEILLANCE DETECTED:
1. Confirm detection
2. Report to TL immediately
3. Document details
4. Do NOT confront
5. Continue naturally

TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE:
- Tracking devices (GPS)
- Audio devices (bugs)
- Visual devices (cameras)
- TSCM (Technical Surveillance Countermeasures)

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- Confront surveillants when detected (wrong - do NOT confront)
- Counter-surveillance prevents surveillance (wrong - that's anti)
- Static surveillance follows target (wrong - that's mobile)
- SDR should be run obviously (wrong - act naturally)
- One sighting confirms surveillance (wrong - need pattern)

================================================================================

Use these scenario types in questions:

- "A CPO notices the same person at two different locations today..."
- "When running a Surveillance Detection Route, the CPO should..."
