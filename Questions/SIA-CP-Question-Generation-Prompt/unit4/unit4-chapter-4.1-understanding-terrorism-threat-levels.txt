UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.1: UNDERSTANDING TERRORISM AND THREAT LEVELS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What does a UK threat level of CRITICAL mean?

A) An attack is possible but not likely
B) An attack is highly likely
C) An attack is expected imminently
D) An attack is unlikely

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: CRITICAL is the highest UK threat level and means an attack 
is expected IMMINENTLY. This is set when there is specific intelligence 
suggesting an attack will happen very soon. At CRITICAL level, CPOs 
should implement maximum protective measures and consider whether 
operations should proceed.
