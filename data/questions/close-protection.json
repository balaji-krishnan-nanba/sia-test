    "question": "During a security review you identify the following issues: The principal’s home address appears in several online articles. The school run for the principal’s children uses the same route and timings every weekday, with minimal escort. Late‑night meetings are held inside a secure office building with access control and CCTV. The principal’s social media posts are delayed by 24 hours and managed by a professional team. Which issue represents the MOST serious vulnerability that should be prioritised for action?",

      "A": "The late‑night meetings in the secure office building.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The predictable school run combines high emotional impact, predictable timings and limited protection, making it an extremely attractive target. The home address being online is a concern, but without the daily predictable movement it is less immediately exploitable.",

      "B": "Focus solely on the principal’s bedroom and ignore adjacent rooms to save time",

      "D": "Rely on the hotel’s routine security patrols instead of conducting your own search"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "An effective premises search is planned and systematic. Using floor plans, allocating clear areas of responsibility, applying a consistent search pattern (perimeter then centre, floor‑to‑ceiling) and documenting results provides the best coverage in limited time.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Open the suitcase carefully to check whether it belongs to a guest",

      "C": "Move the suitcase to an empty room and then call hotel security",
      "D": "Ignore it because service corridors often contain abandoned luggage"

    "question": "A high-profile principal with a known threat is scheduled for a hospital appointment in a busy city. The team has identified: A primary route using main roads with limited choke points and several safe havens A significantly different alternate route of similar length using other main roads An emergency route running directly from both the residence and hospital to police headquarters To maximise preparedness, which plan is MOST appropriate?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Practise only the emergency route, as it will cover any situation",
      "B": "Brief only the driver on the alternate route to reduce information leaks",
      "C": "Recce and rehearse all three routes, brief the whole team on when to transition between them, and confirm safe havens and communication coverage along each",
      "D": "Use the primary route for all future movements because it has already been assessed as the safest"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "All three route types serve different purposes. The team must understand and rehearse primary, alternate and emergency routes, know triggers for changing between them, and confirm support (safe havens, communications) on each, especially in a known threat environment.",

    "question": "For three weeks, the principal has attended a regular event at the same venue. The current pattern is to exit the car park, turn left at the traffic lights, and pass through a narrow underpass before joining the main road. The threat level has recently increased. Which change will MOST reduce the risk associated with this predictable choke point?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Continue using the same exit and underpass, but ask the principal to sit farther from the windows",
      "B": "Use the same underpass but instruct the driver to accelerate aggressively through it",
      "C": "Keep the route but change the vehicle’s colour to make it less recognisable",
      "D": "Identify and use an alternative exit and different approach roads that avoid the underpass on some journeys, varying both route and timing while keeping pre-planned emergency options"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The risk stems from a predictable choke point and routine. Avoiding the underpass where possible, varying exit routes and timings, and maintaining emergency options reduces the chance of a planned ambush at that fixed location.",

The route plan identifies two potential safe havens ahead: A small village GP surgery 5 minutes away, closed at this time but with a public phone nearby A larger town 15 minutes away with a 24-hour hospital and police station What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",

      "A": "Stop immediately in the next lay-by and wait for an ambulance to find you",
      "B": "Proceed as directly and safely as possible to the town with the 24-hour hospital, informing control or emergency services en route as soon as signal allows",

    "options": {
      "A": "Place all security staff in the public foyer and leave the rest of the venue uncontrolled to avoid upsetting guests",

    "question": "A high-profile principal is leaving a theatre via a wide pavement where hostile protesters are present on BOTH sides of the route. Threat level is high and the team has four CPOs. They need strong lateral and rear protection for a 40-metre walk to a vehicle. Which formation is MOST suitable?",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "With protesters on both sides and a high threat level, the box formation is ideal: it gives strong lateral, forward, and rear protection with four CPOs forming a close human shield around the principal.",

    "question": "You are leaving a concert venue with the principal when a hostile crowd forms near the main entrance, pushing and shouting. You have three possible routes: Route 1: Straight through the main entrance towards the waiting car on the street, but the crowd is dense and agitated. Route 2: A side fire exit with a clear corridor leading directly to a secure car park where the principal’s vehicle and support team are waiting. Route 3: A rear service corridor that is poorly lit, cluttered with crates and has limited visibility. What is the BEST route to choose for evacuation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Route 2 – the side fire exit to the secure car park with a clear path and known safe destination",
      "B": "Stay inside the foyer and wait for the crowd to calm down",

    "explanation": "Dynamic environmental assessment looks at exits, hazards, crowd dynamics and safe destinations. Route 2 provides a clear, controlled path to a secure area where the vehicle and support are ready. Pushing through a hostile crowd or using a cluttered, poorly lit corridor increases risk.",

Routine CCTV (B) and media work (D) are usually legitimate activities, and general curiosity (C) alone is not hostile unless supported by other indicators.

It is rarely confined to the immediate minutes before an attack (A). It does not depend on a previous failed attack (C) and is just as relevant in the UK as overseas (D).

    "explanation": "The interview stance is a bladed stance at about 45° to the threat, with feet shoulder‑width apart, weight mainly on the back foot and knees slightly bent.

    "explanation": "The prone (face down) position carries the highest risk of positional asphyxia because the chest and abdomen can be compressed, restricting breathing.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Adrenaline can mask pain and injury immediately after incidents, and blood exposure may carry infection risks. You should report concerns, seek medical advice and not drive or return to duty if your injury, tiredness or emotional state could affect safety.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Rely on the original training only – once qualified, no further learning is needed",

      "C": "Keep the licence renewed, attend refresher and update training, stay informed about legal and industry changes, and reflect on incidents to improve skills",
