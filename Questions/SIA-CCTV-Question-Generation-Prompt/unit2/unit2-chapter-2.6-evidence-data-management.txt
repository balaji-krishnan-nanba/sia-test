UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.6: EVIDENCE AND DATA MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the purpose of maintaining chain of custody for CCTV evidence?

A) To increase storage capacity
B) To prove evidence has not been tampered with
C) To speed up the export process
D) To reduce equipment costs

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Chain of custody is maintained to prove that evidence has not 
been tampered with from the point of preservation to presentation in court. 
It documents every person who handled the evidence, when they handled it, 
and what they did with it. This allows courts to trust the evidence.
