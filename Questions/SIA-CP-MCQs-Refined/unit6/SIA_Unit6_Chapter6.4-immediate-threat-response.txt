UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.4: CONTROL AND RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the HIGHEST risk position for positional asphyxia?

A) Recovery position (on side)
B) Seated position
C) Prone position (face down)
D) Supine position (face up)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The prone (face down) position carries the highest risk of positional asphyxia because the chest and abdomen can be compressed, restricting breathing. If a prone restraint is absolutely necessary, it must be for the minimum possible time and the person should be moved to a safer position (ideally recovery) as soon as it is safe to do so.

Question 2 [Easy]
In a close protection context, when is physical restraint MOST appropriate?

A) When evacuation is not possible and a continuing threat must be neutralised to protect the principal
B) As the first response to any disorder near the principal
C) Whenever a member of the public verbally abuses the principal
D) Whenever the principal asks the team to “teach someone a lesson”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In CP, evacuation is the primary response. Restraint is a secondary option used only when necessary – for example, when evacuation is not possible or a continuing threat must be neutralised first. It must be necessary, proportionate and focused on protecting the principal, not punishing the subject.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which standing control technique typically places the subject’s arm behind their back and uses rotation at the shoulder joint to gain strong control?

A) Wrist lock
B) Shoulder lock
C) Arm bar
D) Leg sweep

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A shoulder lock normally involves placing the arm behind the back and rotating at the shoulder to gain control. Wrist locks act mainly through the wrist joint, arm bars extend the arm and act through the elbow, and leg sweeps are used for takedowns rather than standing control.

Question 4 [Easy]
Why might a CPO decide to use ground control instead of continuing with a standing restraint?

A) To punish the person by making the restraint more painful
B) So the CPO can kneel with full body weight on the person’s back
C) To avoid having to call the police
D) Because a controlled descent to the ground can provide greater safety and control when standing techniques are failing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Ground control may be appropriate when standing control is failing or the subject is too strong, and continued standing struggle creates unnecessary risk. A controlled descent (not a throw or slam) can provide safer control while awaiting police. It must still be as safe as possible and time-limited due to increased risks on the ground.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which of the following is an EARLY warning sign of positional asphyxia during restraint?

A) The person says they are struggling to breathe and can only speak in single words
B) The person continues shouting clearly and swearing at staff
C) The person’s breathing is calm and regular
D) The person asks for a glass of water

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Difficulty breathing, gasping, and only being able to speak in single words are key warning signs of positional asphyxia. They indicate the person cannot get enough air. Shouting clearly, calm breathing or normal conversation are not typical early indicators of breathing compromise.

Question 6 [Easy]
Why should rigid handcuffs be double locked as soon as practicable after application?

A) To make it harder for police to remove them later
B) To prevent the cuffs tightening further and reduce the risk of nerve and circulation damage
C) To allow the restrained person to tighten the cuffs themselves
D) To stop the handcuff key from working

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Double locking prevents the ratchet from moving tighter, which reduces the risk of nerve damage, circulation problems and unnecessary pain. It is an essential safety step when using cuffs. It does not make removal harder for police and does not stop the key from working.

Question 7 [Easy]
In a multiple attacker situation, what is the PRIMARY objective for a close protection team?

A) To restrain every attacker on the ground
B) To pursue attackers who flee the scene
C) To protect and evacuate the principal using the minimum engagement necessary
D) To stay and assist police with crowd control

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Principal safety and evacuation remain the top priority in CP, especially with multiple attackers. The team should engage only as much as is necessary to create an escape opportunity and move the principal to safety, rather than trying to control everyone.

Question 8 [Easy]
When police arrive to take over a detained person, what should a CPO do FIRST?

A) Immediately remove all restraints and walk away
B) Start questioning the detained person in front of the police
C) Leave the principal unattended and join the arrest
D) Clearly identify themselves and briefly explain who is detained and why

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: On police arrival, the CPO should identify themselves and provide a clear, concise briefing about what happened and why the person is detained. The police then take control. Restraints should only be removed when the police are ready and instruct it.

Question 9 [Easy]
After a struggle and restraint, which of the following signs in the detained person should be treated as an immediate medical emergency?

A) The person suddenly becomes unresponsive and collapses
B) The person complains that the cuffs are uncomfortable but remains alert
C) The person is breathing faster after exertion but can talk normally
D) The person is angry and shouting about being restrained

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Sudden unresponsiveness or collapse must always be treated as a medical emergency. The CPOs should check airway and breathing, place the person in the recovery position if safe, and call an ambulance. Discomfort, anger or normal post-exertion breathing do not carry the same immediate red flag.

Question 10 [Medium]
In a hotel lobby, an intoxicated man grabs the principal’s arm. You free the principal and move them behind you, but the man now stands between you and the exit, shouting and making threats. Police have been called but are several minutes away. What is the MOST appropriate use of restraint in this situation?

A) Immediately tackle him to the floor and keep him prone until police arrive, even once a path is clear
B) Focus solely on restraining the man, leaving the principal unattended in the lobby
C) Use only the force necessary to gain temporary control, clear a path, and move the principal away, maintaining restraint only until evacuation is safe
D) Do nothing until police arrive, even if the man resumes attacking

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Evacuation is the primary objective. Limited, necessary restraint can be used to neutralise the threat long enough to clear a path and evacuate the principal. Prolonged prone restraint or ignoring a renewed attack would be unsafe; abandoning the principal to focus only on the subject reverses CP priorities.

Question 11 [Medium]
During a red-carpet event, an aggressive fan pushes towards the principal. A CPO intercepts, applies an arm bar and escorts the person away from the principal while another CPO moves the principal quickly to the vehicle. Which statement BEST describes this use of standing control?

A) It is inappropriate because standing controls must always lead directly to ground restraints
B) It is unsafe because escorting an aggressive person while walking is never acceptable
C) It is excessive force because any physical contact in close protection is unlawful
D) It is appropriate: a standing control and escort position are used to direct the person away while maintaining focus on evacuating the principal

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Standing controls such as an arm bar or escort position are designed to give directional control over a person while maintaining a professional appearance. Used proportionately and alongside evacuation of the principal, this is an appropriate CP response.

Question 12 [Medium]
A CPO applies a wrist lock to gain control of a resisting subject’s arm. The person complies when the pressure is increased slightly. How should the CPO manage the use of pain compliance in this situation?

A) Maintain maximum pressure to prevent any further resistance
B) Reduce the pressure as soon as the person complies, using only the minimum required to maintain control
C) Alternate between high and low pressure to “teach them a lesson”
D) Immediately switch to a choke hold to increase control

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pain compliance is used to encourage cooperation, not to punish. Pressure should be progressive and reduced once the subject complies, maintaining only the level necessary for control. Excessive or punitive pain, or escalating to dangerous techniques, is unlawful and unsafe.

Question 13 [Medium]
During an escort, a very strong subject repeatedly breaks a standing shoulder lock and attempts to punch the CPO. Two other CPOs are available to assist. What is the MOST appropriate next step?

A) Use a controlled team takedown to the ground to gain safer control while avoiding impact with the floor
B) Continue attempting the same standing lock even though it is failing
C) Release the subject completely and hope they calm down on their own
D) Trip the subject violently so they hit the floor as hard as possible to stop the fight

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When standing controls repeatedly fail and the subject is actively violent, a controlled team takedown to the ground may provide safer control than a continued standing struggle. The descent must be controlled, not a slam, and the team should still minimise time on the ground.

Question 14 [Medium]
A subject is being held prone (face down) on the ground by three CPOs while police are on the way. Which approach BEST reduces the risk of positional asphyxia?

A) Placing one CPO’s full body weight across the subject’s upper back to stop all movement
B) Keeping the prone phase as brief as possible, avoiding pressure on the back or chest, and planning to move the person to a safer position as soon as practicable
C) Ignoring the subject’s breathing as long as they remain handcuffed
D) Keeping the subject face down until the police arrive, regardless of how long it takes

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Prone restraint carries the highest asphyxia risk. It should be used only if necessary, with no weight on the torso, constant monitoring of breathing and responsiveness, and for the minimum possible time before moving to a safer position such as seated or recovery when safe.

Question 15 [Medium]
While controlling a person who has been extremely agitated and appears intoxicated, the CPOs notice “superhuman” strength, very high body temperature and bizarre behaviour, with little response to pain. What should they recognise about this situation?

A) The person is simply being awkward and should be restrained as long as possible
B) The signs are normal after any restraint and require no action
C) The person may be experiencing excited delirium and must be treated as a medical emergency with minimal restraint and urgent ambulance support
D) The behaviour means the person cannot feel pain, so more force can safely be applied

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Superhuman strength, extreme agitation, bizarre behaviour, raised body temperature and poor response to pain are classic signs of excited delirium (acute behavioural disturbance). This is a medical emergency with a high risk of sudden death. Restraint should be the minimum necessary and medical help summoned immediately.

Question 16 [Medium]
After safely applying rigid handcuffs behind a subject’s back, what is the MOST important next action for the CPO?

A) Move the person straight into a prolonged prone position to ensure they cannot escape
B) Immediately leave the person unattended while you brief the principal
C) Tighten the cuffs further until the subject stops complaining
D) Check that the cuffs are snug but not over-tight, double lock them, and monitor the person’s circulation and comfort

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: After cuffing, the CPO must ensure the cuffs are correctly positioned, double locked and not causing excessive pressure. Circulation and comfort (within reason) must be checked and monitored as part of the duty of care. Prolonged prone restraint and leaving the person unattended are unsafe.

Question 17 [Medium]
A CP team with three CPOs is escorting a principal to a vehicle when two attackers rush towards them. One attacker moves directly at the principal; the other hangs back shouting and filming. What is the MOST appropriate team response?

A) One CPO intercepts and controls the attacker closest to the principal while the others focus on shielding and evacuating the principal to the vehicle
B) All three CPOs rush to restrain both attackers, leaving the principal momentarily exposed
C) The team ignores the attackers and continues as normal, hoping they give up
D) Two CPOs chase the filming attacker while the principal waits in the open

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The attacker posing the immediate threat to the principal must be intercepted, but principal safety and evacuation remain the main objective. One CPO engages the immediate threat while the others shield and move the principal to safety, rather than trying to restrain everyone.

Question 18 [Medium]
Two CPOs have secured a highly resistant subject using a double-wrist standing hold. The subject suddenly stops struggling and becomes compliant. What is the BEST way to manage this change?

A) Maintain exactly the same level of pressure on the joints to ensure they do not resist again
B) Gradually reduce the pressure while maintaining secure control, communicating with the subject and monitoring for signs of distress or injury
C) Instantly release the subject because they have stopped struggling
D) Increase the pressure to discourage any future resistance

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: As with pain compliance, joint pressure should be proportional. Once the subject complies, pressure should be eased to the minimum necessary for safe control, while communicating and monitoring their condition. Over-tightening or sudden release can both create risk.

Question 19 [Medium]
A restrained subject has been held on the ground in a supine (face up) position for several minutes while police are en route. They are now calm but breathing heavily and complaining of chest tightness. What should the CPOs do NEXT?

A) Keep them supine and ignore the complaint until police arrive
B) Roll them back into a prone position for additional control
C) Remove all restraints and walk away to rejoin the principal
D) Move them into a recovery position if safe, continue monitoring breathing, and be prepared to call an ambulance if symptoms worsen

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Complaints of chest tightness and heavy breathing after restraint must be taken seriously. If it is safe, the person should be placed in the recovery position to maximise airway and breathing, monitored closely, and medical help sought if there is any deterioration.

Question 20 [Hard]
During a struggle in a car park, three CPOs have taken an attacker to the ground in a prone position to protect the principal. The attacker has been held face down for several minutes with arm control only. They were shouting and struggling strongly, but now suddenly go quiet, stop resisting and their breathing sounds gurgling. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?

A) Assume they have simply calmed down and maintain the hold until police arrive
B) Tighten the restraint and add pressure to the back to ensure they cannot move
C) Treat this as a warning sign of positional asphyxia, release pressure, reposition them (e.g. into recovery), check responsiveness and breathing, and call for medical assistance
D) Remove all restraints and walk away to avoid liability

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Sudden stillness, change in breathing and gurgling noises after intense struggling are classic danger signs for positional asphyxia or collapse. The CPOs must immediately reduce restraint, reposition to protect airway and breathing, assess responsiveness and call for urgent medical help.

Question 21 [Hard]
At a private event, an individual punches the principal in the face. Two CPOs separate them and apply a standing control hold on the attacker while the third shields the principal. The attacker continues to threaten violence. Police have been called but are 15 minutes away, and the exit route for the principal is now clear. Which course of action BEST reflects lawful restraint and CP priorities?

A) One CPO maintains the minimum necessary control over the attacker as a citizen’s arrest while another escorts the principal to safety and the team prepares to brief police on arrival
B) All CPOs remain physically engaged with the attacker and delay moving the principal until police arrive
C) Release the attacker immediately because only the police are allowed to detain someone
D) Keep the attacker pinned in a prolonged prone restraint to punish them for assaulting the principal

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: An assault on the principal is an indictable offence and may justify a citizen’s arrest using necessary and proportionate force. However, principal safety is still the priority. One CPO can maintain lawful, minimal control over the attacker while others evacuate the principal and prepare for a full police handover.

Question 22 [Hard]
A violent intruder at a private residence has been handcuffed by the CP team using rigid cuffs behind the back. The principal has been evacuated safely. Police are delayed, and the intruder has been restrained for over 10 minutes after a very intense struggle. They complain of chest pain and difficulty breathing. What is the BEST overall response by the team?

A) Ignore the complaints because the subject may be exaggerating and maintain the restraint unchanged until police arrive
B) Treat the situation as a potential medical emergency: check cuff tightness and circulation, adjust their position to aid breathing (e.g. seated or recovery if safe), call an ambulance, continue monitoring, and record observations and actions taken
C) Immediately remove all restraints and allow the subject to leave to avoid liability
D) Tighten the cuffs and place them in a prone position to stop further complaints

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Chest pain and breathing difficulty after prolonged restraint are clear reasons to seek medical help. The team must maintain necessary control but adjust positioning to support breathing, check cuffs, call an ambulance, continue monitoring and document all actions. Duty of care continues until handover to police or medical professionals.

Question 23 [Hard]
Outside a venue, a CP team restrains one attacker on the ground after a serious assault attempt on the principal. Two of the attacker’s associates remain nearby, shouting abuse and edging closer but not yet attacking. Police are on their way. What is the MOST appropriate tactical approach?

A) Release the restrained attacker and focus solely on moving the principal
B) Leave the restrained attacker unattended while all CPOs form a cordon around the principal
C) Keep the restrained attacker under minimum necessary control with one or two CPOs, maintain distance and verbal warnings to the associates, prioritise moving the principal to safety, and then carry out a structured handover to police
D) Attempt to restrain all three individuals on the ground to show control of the situation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The team must balance duty of care to the restrained attacker with ongoing protection of the principal and the threat from associates. Minimum necessary control should be maintained on the detained person, while other team members create distance, protect and move the principal, and prepare for a safe, clear police handover.
