UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.2: LEGISLATION AND CODES OF PRACTICE FOR CCTV

Question 1 [Easy]
Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which body oversees the
Surveillance Camera Code of Practice?

A) The Information Commissioner's Office
B) The Security Industry Authority
C) The Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner
D) The Home Office

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner oversees the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice. This role replaced the former Surveillance Camera Commissioner in 2022. They promote compliance with the Code, provide guidance, review how it is implemented and report to Parliament.

Question 2 [Easy]
A town-centre public space CCTV scheme is operated by the local council.
Why must the council have regard to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice?

A) Because as a “relevant authority” under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, it is legally required to have regard to the Code when using CCTV
B) Because every SIA CCTV licence holder is personally criminally liable if the Code is not followed
C) Because the Code is criminal law that applies to anyone who owns a camera, including private householders
D) Because otherwise the local media automatically gain control over the CCTV system

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Police, Police and Crime Commissioners, local authorities and certain other public bodies are “relevant authorities” under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 and must have regard to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice when operating surveillance camera systems.

Question 3 [Easy]
A privately run shopping centre has its own CCTV control room.
How does the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice generally apply to them?

A) It has no relevance at all to private sector CCTV systems
B) It only applies to cameras that face onto public roads
C) It applies in exactly the same mandatory way as it does to the police and local authorities
D) It is voluntary, but widely regarded as best practice and may be required by contracts or policies

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: For most private sector operators, the Code is not legally mandatory but is strongly recommended as best practice. Many contracts with public bodies, insurers or clients expect compliance with the Code and its 12 guiding principles.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which of the following best describes Guiding Principle 1 of the
Surveillance Camera Code of Practice?

A) CCTV use must be as transparent as possible, with published contact points for information and complaints
B) CCTV must only be used for a specified purpose which is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and necessary to meet an identified pressing need
C) Access to retained images must be restricted with clear rules on who can view them and for what reasons
D) Any reference database used for matching must be accurate and kept up to date

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Guiding Principle 1 requires that a surveillance camera system is used only for a clearly specified purpose, in pursuit of a legitimate aim, and where its use is necessary to meet an identified pressing need. This goes to the heart of justifying why CCTV is installed at all.

Question 5 [Easy]
Guiding Principle 2 mainly requires CCTV operators to:

A) Consider the impact of surveillance on individuals and their privacy and carry out regular reviews to ensure the system remains justified
B) Store all captured images indefinitely in case they are needed in the future
C) Publish all CCTV footage online so the public can review it
D) Allow any member of staff to view recordings to “improve awareness”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Principle 2 focuses on privacy and proportionality. Operators must take into account the effect on individuals and regularly review the system to ensure its continued justification, adjusting it if it becomes disproportionate.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which data protection principle requires CCTV operators to ensure that
time stamps and information on recordings are correct and kept up to date?

A) Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
B) Accuracy
C) Storage limitation
D) Accountability

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The accuracy principle under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 requires personal data to be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. This includes ensuring that time and date settings and camera identifiers are correct so the footage can be reliably used as evidence.
ICO

Question 7 [Medium]
During a review meeting, your control room manager suggests increasing
retention of all public space CCTV recordings from 31 days to 12 months,
even though there is no evidence this is needed. They also propose adding
cameras inside staff rest areas “just in case”. Which principle best supports
your concern that this may be excessive?

A) Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
B) Accountability
C) Accuracy
D) Data minimisation and storage limitation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Both the Surveillance Camera Code (Principle 6) and UK GDPR require data minimisation and storage limitation. Only images necessary for the stated purpose should be collected and kept, and they should be deleted once that purpose has been fulfilled. Excessive retention and unnecessary coverage of private staff areas could be disproportionate.

Question 8 [Medium]
Your company has installed new CCTV in a multi-storey car park. You are
asked to check if the proposed signage meets transparency requirements.
Which sign wording best satisfies legal expectations?

A) “Smile – you’re on camera!”
B) “CCTV IN USE”
C) “CCTV in operation – operated by ABC Parking Ltd for crime prevention and public safety. Enquiries: 01234 567890”
D) “Recording in progress – no liability accepted”

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: CCTV signage must clearly state that CCTV is in use, identify the data controller (the organisation operating the system), give the purpose (for example, crime prevention) and provide contact details for enquiries.
ICO

Question 9 [Easy]
A member of the public emails the council CCTV control room requesting
a copy of footage showing themselves and states that this is a Subject
Access Request (SAR). The request is straightforward. How long does the
data controller normally have to respond?

A) One calendar month from receipt of the request
B) 14 working days from receipt of the request
C) 28 calendar days from the end of the month in which the request was made
D) 40 working days from receipt of the request

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, a controller must usually respond to a SAR without undue delay and within one calendar month of receipt. In complex cases the deadline can be extended by up to a further two months, but the requester must be informed within the first month.

Question 10 [Medium]
Your organisation receives a very complex SAR for CCTV footage covering
multiple cameras and dates. It will take a lot of time to locate and review
all relevant images and redact third parties. What may the data controller
do about the time limit?

A) Automatically extend the time limit by 28 days for every SAR
B) Extend the time limit by up to two further months because the request is complex, but inform the requester within the first month
C) Extend the time limit indefinitely until staff have time to deal with it
D) Refuse the request and tell the person to use the Freedom of Information Act instead

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: For complex or numerous SARs, the controller may extend the response period by up to two additional months (maximum three calendar months in total), but must notify the requester of the extension and the reasons within the first month.

Question 11 [Medium]
A person asks the local authority CCTV control room for “all CCTV footage
you hold of me from last Saturday evening”, saying they will make a
Freedom of Information request. What is the most appropriate advice?

A) Treat it as a Freedom of Information Act request because CCTV recordings are always FOI matters
B) Tell them they must ask the police because CCTV footage cannot be supplied directly to the public
C) Explain that because they are asking for their own personal data, they should make a Subject Access Request under data protection law
D) Refuse the request because CCTV is exempt from any form of public access

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Requests for a person’s own footage are made under data protection law using a Subject Access Request. FOI is used to request general recorded information held by public authorities, such as policies, statistics or numbers of cameras, not someone’s personal data (which is normally exempt under FOI).

Question 12 [Easy]
Which of the following CCTV recordings would clearly be treated as
personal data under the Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR?

A) A heavily blurred image of a crowd where no person can be identified
B) An empty corridor with no people or vehicles visible
C) A test recording of a camera’s colour bars carried out by an engineer
D) A recording clearly showing an identifiable person entering a building along with their vehicle registration number

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Personal data is information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. A clear recording showing a person and their vehicle registration is personal data because the individual can be identified from the images and associated information.

Question 13 [Medium]
A local authority owns a public space CCTV system but contracts a private
company to staff and operate the control room on its behalf. In most cases,
who is the data controller for the CCTV footage?

A) The local authority
B) The private security company operating the control room
C) The individual CCTV operator on duty at the time
D) The Surveillance Camera Commissioner

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The data controller is the organisation that decides the purposes and means of processing – here, the local authority that owns and determines how the CCTV system is used. The contractor typically acts as a data processor, following the controller’s instructions under a written contract.

Question 14 [Medium]
CCTV was installed in a depot car park to prevent theft and vandalism. A
manager now wants to use old footage to check which staff arrive late,
without informing them and without updating any policies. Which data
protection principle is most at risk?

A) Accuracy
B) Purpose limitation – data must only be used for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes
C) Storage limitation
D) The right to erasure

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The purpose limitation principle requires that data is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. Using footage collected for crime prevention to secretly monitor staff punctuality is likely to breach this principle.
ICO

Question 15 [Easy]
Which statement about the placement of CCTV warning signs is correct?

A) Signs only need to be used if audio is also recorded
B) Signs only need to be displayed inside the control room
C) Signs should be clearly visible and placed so people can see them before entering the monitored area
D) Signs are optional if cameras are mounted on public streets

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: To ensure fair and transparent processing, CCTV signs should be clearly visible, legible and positioned so individuals are aware they are entering an area covered by surveillance before they are recorded, typically at points of entry.

Question 16 [Medium]
A resident complains that a public space CCTV camera overlooks their flat
and can see directly into their living room. The camera is also used to
monitor a busy pedestrian area where there have been assaults. As a CCTV
operator, what is the most appropriate action to suggest?

A) Ignore the complaint because there is no expectation of privacy anywhere near a town centre
B) Turn the camera off permanently so there is no risk to privacy
C) Increase zoom so that the resident’s complaint can be investigated more closely
D) Ask that the system owner reviews the camera’s view and uses privacy masking or repositioning so it still meets its security purpose while minimising intrusion into private homes

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Under Article 8 (right to private life) and Guiding Principles 1 and 2, surveillance must be necessary and proportionate. Adjusting the camera or adding privacy masking allows the system to meet its legitimate aim (public safety) while reducing unnecessary intrusion into private homes.
ICO

Question 17 [Medium]
The police ask you to help set up a hidden camera overlooking a suspect’s
front door as part of a specific investigation. They say it will be run as
“directed surveillance”. Before assisting, what should you be satisfied about?

A) That appropriate RIPA authorisation for directed surveillance has been granted by a designated person and that instructions are documented
B) That your shift supervisor thinks it is a good idea
C) That the suspect does not live in your local area
D) That the camera is hidden well enough that nobody will ever notice it

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Covert, targeted surveillance for a specific investigation that is likely to obtain private information is “directed surveillance” and normally requires authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) by a designated senior officer. Operators should not carry out such surveillance without proper authorisation and instructions.

Question 18 [Easy]
Which of the following situations would normally not require
authorisation under RIPA?

A) Covertly placing a hidden camera in a private staff room to monitor an employee
B) Routine monitoring of visible town-centre cameras, with CCTV signs displayed to the public
C) Plain-clothes officers secretly filming a suspect from an unmarked vehicle
D) Installing a hidden camera inside a private home without the occupant’s knowledge

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: RIPA is mainly concerned with covert surveillance. Normal overt public space CCTV, where cameras and signage are visible and no specific individual is being covertly targeted, is not usually considered directed surveillance and does not require RIPA authorisation.

Question 19 [Medium]
A police officer phones the control room and asks for a copy of footage of
an assault “as soon as possible”. You do not yet have a written request.
What is the most appropriate response?

A) Refuse to deal with the police unless they first obtain a court order
B) Immediately send the clip to the officer’s personal mobile phone to save time
C) Verify the officer’s identity and details of the incident, ask for an auditable request (e.g. form or email), then disclose the necessary footage via the agreed procedure and log the disclosure
D) Allow the officer unrestricted access to the control room to view all recordings and take whatever copies they want

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Police are a common lawful recipient of CCTV footage, but operators must still verify identity, ensure there is a lawful basis for disclosure, follow the agreed disclosure procedure (often requiring a written or logged request), and record what was released to maintain an audit trail and chain of custody.

Question 20 [Hard]
Your system automatically overwrites recordings after 31 days. A member
of the public makes a valid SAR for footage of themselves from an incident
that happened about six weeks ago. When you check, the footage has
already been overwritten. What should the data controller do?

A) Try to “undelete” the footage, even if this means hiring a specialist company
B) Refuse to reply, as there is no footage so the request is invalid
C) Immediately change the retention period to one year and tell the requester you will respond when enough new data has been collected
D) Respond within the SAR time limit explaining that the footage is no longer held because it was deleted in line with the documented retention policy, so a copy cannot be provided

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Controllers are not required to keep footage indefinitely “just in case” of SARs. If a SAR is received after footage has been lawfully deleted in accordance with a documented retention schedule, the controller should still respond within the time limit, explaining that the data is no longer held and why.

Question 21 [Medium]
You are exporting CCTV of a serious assault for use in court. Which practice
best helps to protect the suspect’s right to a fair trial (Article 6) and the
evidential value of the footage?

A) Following a documented procedure: export the footage, label and seal it, log who handled it and keep the original recording secure and unaltered
B) Editing the footage to remove “boring” sections so it is quicker for the court to watch
C) Allowing multiple staff to copy the footage onto USB sticks without recording who did so
D) Changing the time and date overlay so it matches a witness’s statement

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A clear chain of custody, accurate time and date information and protection of the original recording from alteration all support the reliability and evidential value of CCTV, helping to protect the fairness of any trial.

Question 22 [Hard]
After a high-profile incident in the town centre, a TV journalist arrives at
the control room and asks you for a copy of the CCTV footage “for
broadcast in the public interest”. What should you do?

A) Give them a copy immediately because the public have a right to know what happened
B) Explain that you cannot release footage directly to the media and refer the request to the data controller’s senior management or press office to consider any lawful basis
C) Allow the journalist to sit in the control room and film the CCTV monitors with their own camera
D) Tell them to submit a SAR for the footage

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Disclosure to the media is highly sensitive and can seriously affect individuals’ privacy and rights. Such decisions must be taken at an appropriate senior level, weighing up data protection, human rights and any legitimate public interest. Operators should not release footage directly to journalists on their own authority.

Question 23 [Hard]
During routine monitoring, an operator repeatedly uses a PTZ camera to
zoom in and follow the same individual walking through the town centre for
several minutes, with no operational reason, while ignoring the rest of the
scene. What is the main legal/ethical concern?

A) It breaches the Freedom of Information Act 2000
B) It automatically makes all footage inadmissible in court
C) It risks a disproportionate interference with the person’s Article 8 right to private life and could amount to unfair, discriminatory targeting
D) It always requires RIPA authorisation because all CCTV use is covert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Even in public spaces, individuals retain some right to privacy. Targeting one person without justification can be disproportionate and may be seen as unfair profiling or discrimination, conflicting with Article 8 and the principles of fair, proportionate surveillance.
ICO

Question 24 [Easy]
Someone emails the council asking: “How many public space CCTV cameras
do you operate and what was the total cost of running them last year?”
What is the most appropriate way to treat this request?

A) Treat it as a SAR because CCTV is involved
B) Refuse the request because CCTV information is confidential
C) Tell them to contact the police instead
D) Treat it as a Freedom of Information request for general recorded information about the CCTV system

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives anyone the right to request recorded information from public authorities, such as numbers of cameras, policies and costs. This is separate from data protection rights, which relate to personal data about an individual.

Question 25 [Medium]
A colleague asks you to replay footage of a neighbour “just out of curiosity”
because they think they saw them in the town centre. There is no
operational reason to do this. Which guiding principle best supports your
refusal?

A) Guiding Principle 7 – access to retained images must be restricted with clear rules on who can access them and for what purpose
B) Guiding Principle 3 – transparency and publication of contact points
C) Guiding Principle 11 – systems should be used to obtain evidential material when there is a pressing need
D) Guiding Principle 8 – technical standards for CCTV equipment

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Principle 7 states that access to retained images must be restricted, with clear rules on who may view them and for what purpose. Viewing footage for curiosity or gossip is an unauthorised purpose and should be refused and reported.
Broxtowe

Question 26 [Medium]
Which action best demonstrates compliance with Guiding Principle 10 of
the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice (review and audit)?

A) Deleting all recordings every 7 days without keeping any logs
B) Carrying out regular documented audits of the CCTV system, checking compliance with policies and legal requirements, and producing management reports
C) Allowing operators to rely only on “common sense” with no written procedures
D) Letting engineers make changes to the system without recording what has been done

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Principle 10 requires effective review and audit mechanisms to ensure that legal requirements, policies and standards are complied with in practice, with regular reporting. Documented audits and management reports show that the system is actively monitored for compliance.

Question 27 [Hard]
A CCTV operator exports a still image of a well-known local celebrity from
the system and shares it on a private social media group as a joke, without
any authorisation. What is the most likely consequence for the operator?

A) Nothing – there is no issue if it was done outside working hours
B) Only the employer can be liable; individual staff cannot face any consequences
C) They may face disciplinary action (including possible dismissal) and could potentially be prosecuted for unlawfully obtaining or disclosing personal data
D) The system will simply receive a small fixed penalty notice, with no impact on individuals

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Unauthorised disclosure of CCTV images for personal reasons can breach data protection law and internal policies. Individuals can face disciplinary action and, in serious cases, criminal prosecution for unlawfully obtaining or disclosing personal data under the Data Protection Act 2018.
ICO

Question 28 [Easy]
Which UK body is primarily responsible for enforcing the Data Protection
Act 2018 and UK GDPR in relation to CCTV use?

A) The Security Industry Authority (SIA)
B) The local authority’s licensing department
C) The Surveillance Camera Commissioner
D) The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is the UK’s independent regulator for data protection and freedom of information. It issues guidance, investigates complaints and can take enforcement action, including fines, where CCTV use breaches data protection law.

Question 29 [Hard]
In your control room, exported CCTV discs are kept in an unlocked drawer
that many staff can access. One disc containing sensitive incident footage
goes missing. Which data protection principle has most clearly been
breached, and what might the consequence be?

A) Security (integrity and confidentiality) – the ICO could investigate and may issue enforcement or a fine against the controller
B) Accuracy – because the footage may now be out of date
C) Purpose limitation – because the footage was not reused for another purpose
D) Storage limitation – because the footage was not deleted quickly enough

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Controllers must implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent unauthorised access, loss or theft of personal data. Poor physical security around exported discs breaches the integrity and confidentiality principle and could lead to ICO enforcement action or penalties if harm results.
ICO

Question 30 [Hard]
A shop owner asks the council CCTV manager to point a public space camera
directly at a rival’s entrance “so we can see how busy they are”. There is
no evidence of crime or disorder at that location. What is the best reason
to refuse this request?

A) The camera does not have enough zoom capability
B) The request does not meet a legitimate aim or pressing need, so using CCTV in this way would not be necessary or proportionate under Guiding Principle 1 and data protection law
C) RIPA requires all CCTV to be authorised for directed surveillance
D) SIA licence conditions prevent operators from ever filming shops

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: CCTV use must pursue a legitimate aim (such as crime prevention or public safety) and be necessary and proportionate to meet a pressing need. Pointing a public camera at a rival’s entrance purely for commercial curiosity fails these tests and would not comply with Guiding Principle 1 or with data protection and human rights requirements.
