Question 1 [Easy]
What does HOT stand for when assessing a suspicious item?

A) Hostile, Obvious, Threatening
B) Hidden, Obviously suspicious, Typical for location
C) Handle, Observe, Tell
D) Hazardous, Out of place, Threatening

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: HOT stands for: Has it been Hidden? Is it Obviously suspicious? 
Is it Typical for this location? This protocol helps assess whether an 
unattended item warrants concern. If the answers suggest it's hidden, 
obviously suspicious, or not typical, it should be reported without touching.
