Question: What is the MAIN purpose of disengagement techniques for a door supervisor?

A) To punish abusive customers to discourage future behaviour
B) To move an unwilling customer out of the venue
C) To escape from a grip or hold and create space to reach safety
D) To stop and restrain a dangerous person until police arrive

Answer: C
Explanation: Disengagement techniques are defensive skills used to break free from grabs or holds and create a reactionary gap so you can move to safety, get help and reassess. They are not about restraining or punishing the person.

---
Q2 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Which of the following best describes what disengagement techniques are NOT intended to be?

A) A defensive response
B) A way to escape danger
C) A method of creating distance
D) An offensive attack

Answer: D
Explanation: Disengagement techniques are used to defend yourself and escape, not to launch attacks or punish someone. They are strictly defensive, safety-focused skills.

Q3 | Difficulty: Easy

Question: In most hand grips, which part is usually the weakest point that breakaway techniques aim to exploit?

A) The wrist
B) The palm
C) The thumb
D) The forearm

Answer: C
Explanation: The thumb is the weakest part of a grip. Effective breakaway techniques pull or rotate towards the gap between the thumb and fingers, where the grip is easiest to break.

---
Q4 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: When breaking a wrist grab, in which direction is it MOST effective to pull your arm?

A) Towards the attacker's little finger
B) Straight up using only arm strength
C) Directly against their four fingers
D) Towards the gap between their thumb and fingers

Answer: D
Explanation: The "weak point rule" says you should pull or rotate towards the space between the thumb and fingers. Attacking this weak point is far more effective than trying to fight the strength of the four fingers.

Q5 | Difficulty: Easy

Question: What does the term reactionary gap mean after a breakaway?

A) The distance needed so a colleague can safely handcuff
B) The minimum distance for you to use kicks
C) The space that gives you time to see and react to further threats
D) A distance that allows you to relax and switch off

Answer: C
Explanation: A reactionary gap is a safe space - ideally at least arm's length or more - that gives you time to observe, think and react if the person tries to attack again.

---
Q6 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Which statement about being on the ground in a confrontation is MOST accurate for a door supervisor?

A) Staying on the ground makes you a smaller target, so it is preferred
B) The ground is very risky, especially if there are multiple attackers
C) The ground is ideal for using pain-compliance techniques
D) The ground is one of the safest places because you can control people better

Answer: B
Explanation: Being on the ground is dangerous: your movement and vision are limited and you are vulnerable to kicks, stomps and multiple attackers. Good practice is to avoid going to ground and, if you do, get up as soon as it is safe.

---
Q7 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: When facing several attackers at once, what should be your main aim?

A) Knock down the person who looks like the leader
B) Hold one attacker until the police arrive
C) Force every attacker to the ground
D) Escape and get to safety as quickly as possible

Answer: D
Explanation: When outnumbered, you should accept that you cannot safely "win" a fight. The priority is to break free, reduce risk and escape to safety, then get help.

---
Q8 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Which area is a HIGH priority to protect during disengagement because injury there can quickly stop you functioning?

A) Head
B) Thigh
C) Calf
D) Upper arm

Answer: A
Explanation: Head injuries can be serious and quickly affect your ability to think, see and coordinate movements. Protecting your head (and neck) is a top priority in any violent confrontation.

---
Q9 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Which of the following is a typical environmental hazard you should avoid when moving during a breakaway?

A) A flat, clear corridor
B) An open car park
C) An open doorway
D) A wet, slippery floor

Answer: D
Explanation: Wet floors greatly increase the risk of slipping and falling, which can send you to the ground or down stairs. Part of good disengagement is avoiding hazards such as wet floors, glass, sharp edges and stairs.

---
Q10 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: You successfully break free from an aggressor's grab. What should you do IMMEDIATELY next?

A) Step forwards to finish the confrontation
B) Create distance between you and the aggressor
C) Sit the person down to talk calmly
D) Turn your back and walk away slowly

Answer: B
Explanation: Breaking the grip is only the first step. You should immediately move away to create a safe reactionary gap before reassessing, using verbal commands or calling for backup.

---
Q11 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: An aggressive customer suddenly grabs your right wrist with one hand. Which response best applies breakaway principles?

A) Strike the customer first and then pull free
B) Rotate your wrist towards their thumb and pull sharply through the gap while stepping away
C) Yank your arm straight back using arm strength only
D) Twist your arm randomly until their grip loosens

Answer: B
Explanation: Effective breakaway targets the weak point of the grip - the thumb. Rotating towards the thumb and pulling through the gap, while moving your body away, uses both technique and body weight rather than pure strength.

---
Q12 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A subject grips your left wrist using BOTH their hands. Which option uses the safest and most effective method to release?

A) Pull directly against their joined fingers as hard as you can
B) Bring your free hand over to reinforce, turn your body and pull through their thumbs while moving away
C) Drop straight to the ground and start kicking at their legs
D) Try to peel off one of their fingers at a time

Answer: B
Explanation: A two-handed grip is stronger, so you add your second hand and body weight to help. Turning your body and pulling through their thumbs follows the same weak-point principle while helping you move away to safety.

Q13 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A customer grabs a handful of your shirt at the chest with one hand and pulls you towards them. Which is the MOST appropriate first response?

A) Immediately head-butt them to stop the behaviour
B) Grab their clothing in the same way to show control
C) Secure their gripping hand, step to the side and work to release the grip while watching for a second hand or strike
D) Ignore the hand and push them in the chest with both palms

Answer: C
Explanation: With a single lapel grab, you should control the gripping hand, move off the direct line (stepping to the side) and release the grip while remaining alert to further strikes. Responding with offensive strikes escalates risk and may be unlawful.

Q14 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Someone grabs a chunk of your hair and pulls. What is the BEST initial action to reduce pain and regain control?

A) Press or trap their gripping hand flat against your head to reduce movement and pain, then work to turn and escape
B) Spin around randomly to surprise them
C) Drop to the floor to make yourself heavier
D) Rip your head straight away from their hand

Answer: A
Explanation: Pressing or clamping their hand against your head reduces the movement and pain, giving you some control. From there you can turn, use your body weight and apply a safe escape technique while protecting your head.

---
Q15 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A subject suddenly places both hands around the front of your neck and starts to squeeze. Which action is MOST important to take first?

A) Lean your head back so you can see them clearly
B) Bring your chin down and shoulders up to protect your airway while working to create space at the neck and break the grip
C) Step closer into them to reduce the pressure
D) Try to shout loudly before doing anything else

Answer: B
Explanation: A front choke is potentially life-threatening. Your first priority is to protect your airway by tucking your chin and lifting your shoulders, then quickly creating space at the neck and breaking the grip so you can breathe and escape.

---
Q16 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: After breaking free you need to create distance from the aggressor in a crowded bar with broken glass on the floor. Which option best reflects good practice?

A) Turn your back and sprint straight for the nearest door, ignoring what's underfoot
B) Stand still so that CCTV can see you clearly
C) Walk backwards slowly in a straight line while looking at them
D) Explosively move away at an angle towards colleagues or an exit, avoiding hazards such as broken glass

Answer: D
Explanation: Creating distance should be fast and decisive, but also controlled and aware of hazards. Moving at an angle towards help or an exit, while avoiding glass and other dangers, meets the aims of safety and escape.

Q17 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: You find yourself pushed against a wall by a customer. Which statement about using the wall is MOST accurate?

A) The wall is always bad; you must get away from it immediately
B) You should bounce the attacker off the wall to punish them
C) The wall can protect your back, but you should use it to help you slide or push off to escape along a safer route
D) You should stay pinned so the person cannot move you

Answer: C
Explanation: A wall can prevent attacks from behind, but you can also use it to help you move - sliding or pushing off to escape along it. Staying pinned or using the wall to punish the person goes against safe, professional practice.

Q18 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Three people are acting aggressively towards you. Which positioning strategy gives you the BEST chance of staying safe?

A) Try to keep them in front of you, using movement and obstacles so they line up rather than surround you
B) Move into the centre of the group so you can watch everyone
C) Keep moving so they spread out around you
D) Stand still so you look more confident

Answer: A
Explanation: With multiple attackers, you want to stop them surrounding you. Moving so they stay in front, and using obstacles to "line them up", reduces the number who can attack you at once and supports your escape.

---
Q19 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: You are knocked to the floor and an aggressor is still nearby. What is your BEST immediate priority?

A) Protect your head and vital areas, use your limbs as a barrier and create space so you can get back up quickly
B) Grab their legs and drag them to the ground with you
C) Stay on your back and trade kicks with them
D) Roll onto your stomach to crawl away

Answer: A
Explanation: On the ground, you are vulnerable. First protect your head and other vital areas, then use your arms and legs to keep distance from the attacker so you can stand up facing the threat and move away.

---
Q20 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Why is regular practice of disengagement and breakaway techniques particularly important for door supervisors?

A) It helps you build muscle memory so you can perform simple, safe techniques effectively under stress
B) It guarantees you will never be taken to the ground
C) It ensures you never feel fear in confrontations
D) It allows you to invent new, more painful techniques

Answer: A
Explanation: Under stress, fine motor skills and decision-making can be affected. Repeated, realistic practice builds muscle memory and confidence so you can use basic, lawful techniques safely and effectively when it matters.

Q21 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You are working at the top of a short staircase. A customer grabs both your lapels with both hands and forces you backwards towards the stairs. There are spilled drinks and broken glass behind you. Which response best follows safe breakaway principles?

A) Brace your feet near the edge of the stairs and try to out-muscle them until colleagues arrive
B) Slap their hands away and drive them backwards down the stairs to regain control of the area
C) Secure their gripping hands, move your weight and feet sideways away from the stair edge while rotating to break the grip through the thumbs, then create distance towards a safer area and call for support
D) Drop to the floor so they cannot push you further

Answer: C
Explanation: This option protects you from the stair and glass hazard, targets the weak point of the grip (the thumbs), and focuses on escape and moving to a safer position with support. The other options increase risk of falls or serious injury.

---
Q22 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You are grabbed by the lapel by one man while two of his friends start to move around you, trying to get behind you. No colleagues are immediately nearby. What is your BEST overall strategy?

A) Use a quick breakaway on the grip, move so all three are in front of you, then head towards an exit or staff area while shouting for help
B) Focus on putting the man holding you into a restraint so the others back away
C) Ignore the grip and punch whoever is closest until they scatter
D) Stand your ground and challenge them loudly to maintain authority

Answer: A
Explanation: With multiple attackers, escape is the priority. Breaking the grip, positioning them in front of you and moving towards safety while calling for help is consistent with the principles of disengagement and multiple-attacker management.

Q23 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During an incident you slip on a wet floor and fall onto your back. The aggressor also falls and momentarily lands across your legs, still holding your clothing. Which sequence of actions best reflects good ground-defence practice?

A) Immediately try to stand up, turning your back on them as you do so
B) Grab their clothing with both hands and pull them fully on top to apply a hold
C) Stay lying down to conserve energy until colleagues arrive
D) Protect your head and neck, use your arms and one leg as a barrier to keep them off your upper body, then create space to stand up facing them and move away

Answer: D
Explanation: On the ground you must first protect vital areas and prevent the person climbing onto your upper body. Using your limbs as a barrier, then creating space to stand up while still facing the threat, supports a safe disengagement and escape.

Q24 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: Late at night in a busy club foyer, you break away from a grab near a glass door while a hostile group of the subject's friends are several metres away watching. Which option best balances your safety, the environment and the risk of the group joining in?

A) Step back towards the friends to show you are not afraid
B) Move quickly to increase distance, using the door frame or furniture as a barrier between you and the subject, position yourself so the group stays in view, and prepare to withdraw further if they advance
C) Immediately chase the subject outside to arrest them
D) Remain close to the subject so they cannot run back inside

Answer: B
Explanation: This option maintains a reactionary gap, uses environmental barriers to slow any attack, and keeps the wider group in view so you can respond if they move. It supports tactical withdrawal and safety rather than chasing or escalating.

Q25 | Difficulty: Hard

Question: After a difficult incident where you had to use several breakaway techniques, you notice later that your reactions felt slow and uncoordinated. According to good practice on training and preparation, what is the BEST response to this?

A) Accept that this is just how you react under pressure and avoid physical intervention in future
B) Blame the venue layout, as training cannot prepare you for real situations
C) Decide to rely more on improvised strikes next time, as they are quicker than practised techniques
D) Arrange to refresh your physical intervention training, including realistic scenario work and stress-based practice, and review the incident so you can improve your responses

Answer: D
Explanation: Regular, realistic training - including stress-inoculation and scenario work - helps you perform better under pressure. Reviewing incidents and updating skills is professional practice and reduces the risk of unsafe or unlawful responses.
