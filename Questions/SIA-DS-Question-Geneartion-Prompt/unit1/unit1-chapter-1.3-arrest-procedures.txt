SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.3
ARREST PROCEDURES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 40 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 1.3 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

This chapter covers the power of arrest available to private citizens, 
including door supervisors. Understanding arrest procedures is critical 
because an unlawful arrest can result in criminal charges against the 
door supervisor and civil claims for false imprisonment.

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 1: Working in the Private Security Industry
- 72 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 110 minutes duration
- 71% pass mark (51 correct answers required)
- This chapter (1.3) is one of 6 chapters in Unit 1

KEY PRINCIPLE: Security operatives have NO special powers of arrest. They 
have only the same powers as any ordinary citizen under Section 24A of the 
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

CHAPTER 1.3: ARREST PROCEDURES - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 40
- Easy (direct recall): 16 questions
- Medium (application): 16 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 8 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.1: POWERS OF ARREST - OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Police vs Citizen Powers:
- Police have broader powers under Section 24 PACE
- Citizens (including security) have limited powers under Section 24A PACE
- Security operatives have NO additional powers beyond ordinary citizens
- "Citizen's arrest" = "any person" arrest

Key Principle:
- Police can arrest on REASONABLE SUSPICION
- Citizens can only arrest when offence HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED
- This is a crucial difference

Section 24A PACE 1984:
- Added by Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005
- Governs citizen's arrest powers
- Very specific conditions must be met
- Applies to INDICTABLE OFFENCES only

What Happens After Arrest:
- Must hand over to police "as soon as practicable"
- Cannot detain indefinitely
- Cannot conduct formal interview
- Cannot charge or punish
- Police take over all further action

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.2: SECTION 24A PACE 1984 - THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The legislation states an arrest by a person other than a constable is lawful 
only if:

CONDITION 1 - OFFENCE REQUIREMENT:

Situation A - Offence In Progress:
- Person IS in the act of committing an indictable offence, OR
- Person IS guilty of an indictable offence (just committed it)

Situation B - Completed Offence:
- An indictable offence HAS BEEN committed (must have actually occurred), AND
- Person IS guilty of that offence (must actually be the guilty party)

CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM POLICE:
- Police can arrest on "reasonable suspicion"
- Citizens can only arrest if offence ACTUALLY occurred and person IS guilty
- If you arrest someone for a crime that didn't happen = UNLAWFUL arrest
- If you arrest wrong person = UNLAWFUL arrest (even if crime did happen)

CONDITION 2 - NECESSITY REQUIREMENT:

The arrest must appear necessary for one of these reasons:
- To prevent the person causing physical injury to themselves or others
- To prevent the person causing loss of or damage to property
- To prevent the person making off before a constable can assume responsibility
- It appears impracticable for a constable to make the arrest

BOTH CONDITIONS MUST BE MET:
- Offence condition satisfied, AND
- Necessity condition satisfied
- Missing either = UNLAWFUL arrest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.3: INDICTABLE OFFENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:
- Serious offences that can be tried in Crown Court
- Includes "either way" offences (can be tried in either court)
- Does NOT include "summary only" offences

INDICTABLE OFFENCES (Arrest Power EXISTS):
- Theft
- Robbery
- Burglary
- Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm (ABH) - Section 47
- Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) - Section 20
- GBH with Intent - Section 18
- Criminal damage over £5,000
- Supply of controlled drugs
- Sexual offences
- Fraud

SUMMARY OFFENCES (NO Citizen's Arrest Power):
- Common assault (no injury)
- Drunk and disorderly
- Being drunk in a public place
- Minor criminal damage (under £5,000)
- Most minor public order offences
- Minor traffic offences

"EITHER WAY" OFFENCES:
- Can be tried in either Magistrates' or Crown Court
- Count as indictable for arrest purposes
- Examples: theft, ABH, criminal damage over £5,000

Practical Test:
- Ask yourself: "Would this likely go to Crown Court?"
- If yes = probably indictable
- If no = probably summary
- When in doubt, err on side of NOT arresting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.4: REASONABLE FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal Basis:

SECTION 3 CRIMINAL LAW ACT 1967:
"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the 
prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of 
offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large."

COMMON LAW:
- Self-defence
- Defence of others
- Defence of property

Requirements for Force to be Lawful:

1. NECESSARY:
- Force must be needed
- No reasonable alternative available
- Cannot use force if other options exist

2. REASONABLE:
- What would an ordinary person consider reasonable?
- Judged by circumstances as they appeared at the time
- Not with benefit of hindsight

3. PROPORTIONATE:
- Level of force matches level of threat
- Minimum force necessary to achieve aim
- Cannot use sledgehammer to crack a nut

The "Honestly Held Belief" Test:
- Judged on circumstances as YOU believed them to be
- Even if mistaken, if belief was honest and genuine
- But belief must be reasonable in the circumstances
- Relevant to self-defence situations

Pre-emptive Action:
- Do NOT have to wait to be hit first
- Can act if threat is imminent
- Pre-emptive strike can be lawful
- Must still be reasonable and proportionate

When Force Becomes UNLAWFUL:
- Threat has ended (person subdued, restrained, fleeing)
- Force continues after threat passed
- Retaliation or punishment (not defence)
- Excessive force beyond what was needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.5: PERFORMING AN ARREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps for Lawful Arrest:

1. TELL THE PERSON THEY ARE UNDER ARREST:
- Make it clear and unambiguous
- "You are under arrest"

2. STATE THE OFFENCE:
- Tell them what they are being arrested for
- "...for assault" / "...for theft"
- Be specific

3. STATE WHY ARREST IS NECESSARY:
- Link to necessity condition
- "...because you may cause injury to others"
- "...to prevent you leaving before police arrive"

What You Do NOT Need to Do:
- Caution the person (police responsibility)
- Read them their rights (police responsibility)
- Conduct a formal interview
- Search them (only safety pat-down if necessary)

What You MUST Do:
- Use minimum force necessary
- Contact police immediately
- Monitor person's welfare
- Hand over to police as soon as practicable

Safety Pat-Down:
- Brief check for weapons for safety
- NOT a search for evidence
- Should be same gender where possible
- Only if necessary for safety

After Arrest:
- Do not question or interview
- Do not leave person unattended
- Monitor breathing, consciousness
- Watch for medical issues
- Preserve any evidence
- Identify witnesses
- Note exact time and circumstances

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.6: WELFARE OF ARRESTED PERSON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duty of Care:
- You have duty of care to person you've arrested
- Must monitor their welfare
- Cannot mistreat or neglect them

Physical Welfare:
- Monitor breathing (especially if restrained)
- Check consciousness and responsiveness
- Watch for injuries
- Position safely (not face down for extended periods)
- Loosen restraints if circulation affected
- Provide medical attention if needed

Positional Asphyxia:
- Risk when person restrained face down
- Weight on back/chest restricts breathing
- Drugs/alcohol increase risk
- Signs: struggling to breathe, going quiet, colour change
- MUST reposition person if this is a concern

Mental Welfare:
- Keep person calm where possible
- Explain what is happening
- Do not threaten or intimidate
- Treat with dignity

Medical Emergencies:
- If person becomes unwell, get medical help immediately
- If in doubt, call ambulance
- Preservation of life takes priority over arrest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.7: HANDOVER TO POLICE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"As Soon As Practicable":
- Must hand over to police without unreasonable delay
- Cannot detain for extended periods
- If police are not coming promptly, reconsider detention

Information to Provide to Police:
- What offence occurred
- What you witnessed
- When and where it happened
- Why you arrested this person
- What force was used (if any)
- Names of any witnesses
- Any evidence secured

Documentation:
- Write full account as soon as possible
- Include all details
- Keep for potential court proceedings
- May be required as witness

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.8: CONSEQUENCES OF UNLAWFUL ARREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Criminal Consequences:
- False imprisonment (potentially serious offence)
- Assault (if force was used)
- Battery
- Possible imprisonment

Civil Consequences:
- Claim for damages (compensation)
- False imprisonment
- Assault and battery
- Negligence
- Can be substantial sums of money

Professional Consequences:
- SIA licence revocation
- Dismissed from employment
- Difficulty finding future work in security
- Criminal record

Employer Consequences:
- Vicarious liability for employee's actions
- Civil claims against company
- Reputational damage
- Insurance implications

Common Mistakes Leading to Unlawful Arrest:
- Arresting for summary offence (no power)
- Arresting wrong person (crime occurred but they didn't do it)
- Arresting when no crime actually occurred
- No necessity condition (police could easily attend)
- Excessive force during or after arrest
- Prolonged detention without handing to police

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.3.9: ALTERNATIVES TO ARREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often Better Options:
- Ejection from premises (for trespass/breach of policy)
- Verbal warning
- Request to leave
- Calling police and letting them arrest
- Gathering evidence for police
- Barring from future entry

When Arrest May Be Appropriate:
- Serious indictable offence committed
- Person is violent threat to others
- Person will definitely escape before police arrive
- Evidence will be lost if person leaves
- Police cannot attend in time

Risk Assessment Before Arrest:
- Is it an indictable offence?
- Did offence definitely occur?
- Is this definitely the right person?
- Is arrest necessary?
- What are the risks of making arrest?
- Are there safer alternatives?
