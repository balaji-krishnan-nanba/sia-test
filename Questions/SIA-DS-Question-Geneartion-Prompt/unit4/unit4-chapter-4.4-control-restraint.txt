SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.4
CONTROL AND RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 24 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 4.4 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification - Physical Intervention Unit.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

WHAT IS UNIT 4?
---------------
Unit 4 focuses on Physical Intervention Skills - the knowledge and 
understanding needed when physical intervention becomes necessary.

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 4: Physical Intervention Skills
- 30 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 45 minutes duration
- 80% pass mark (24 correct answers required)
- This chapter (4.4) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 4

KEY PRINCIPLE
-------------
Control and restraint is about managing a person safely - whether escorting 
them from premises or holding them for police. The focus is on non-pain 
compliant techniques that control through balance and leverage rather than 
causing pain.

CHAPTER 4.4: CONTROL AND RESTRAINT - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 24
- Easy (direct recall): 10 questions
- Medium (application): 9 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 5 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.1: PURPOSES OF CONTROL AND RESTRAINT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Restrain Someone:

EJECTION:
- Removing trespasser from premises
- After permission to be there withdrawn
- Minimum force necessary
- Must have given reasonable time to leave voluntarily

PREVENTING VIOLENCE:
- Stop ongoing assault
- Prevent imminent attack
- Protect victims
- Restrain until threat passed

LAWFUL ARREST:
- Citizen's arrest (Section 24A PACE)
- Hold for police
- Indictable offences only
- Must be necessary

SELF-DEFENCE:
- Preventing attack on yourself
- Restraint as alternative to striking
- Proportionate response
- Until threat neutralised

Restraint Must Be:
- Legally justified
- Necessary
- Proportionate
- Minimum required
- Continuously reassessed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.2: NON-PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Non-Pain Compliance:
- Control without deliberately causing pain
- Uses balance, leverage, positioning
- Guides rather than forces
- Lower risk of injury
- More professionally defensible

Why Preferred in Security:

ETHICAL:
- More humane approach
- Respects dignity
- Avoids unnecessary suffering

PRACTICAL:
- Less likely to escalate
- Pain can increase resistance
- Pain can trigger fight response
- Injured person = problems

LEGAL:
- Easier to justify
- More proportionate
- Less risk of excessive force claim
- Demonstrates professionalism

How Non-Pain Control Works:
- Control balance (person off-balance)
- Control movement (guide direction)
- Use leverage (mechanical advantage)
- Use body weight (not just strength)
- Position advantage

When Pain May Be Necessary:
- Non-pain methods not working
- Person poses serious danger
- Proportionate to threat
- Still minimum necessary
- Reassess constantly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.3: HOLDING TECHNIQUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Principles:

CONTROL THE ARM:
- Arms can strike
- Arms can grab weapons
- Arm control limits options
- Wrist and elbow key points

CONTROL THE BALANCE:
- Off-balance person easier to control
- Use body positioning
- Lower their centre of gravity
- Keep yours stable

FIGURE FOUR HOLD:
- Common arm control technique
- Forms figure "4" shape
- Controls wrist and elbow
- Non-pain compliant
- Allows guiding movement

DOUBLE WRIST HOLD:
- Both hands controlling one wrist
- Allows guiding
- Can move person
- Less controlling than figure four

Positioning:
- Stay to side of person
- Not directly in front (kick zone)
- Not directly behind (can't see)
- Close enough to control
- Able to move with them

Stance During Hold:
- Low centre of gravity
- Balanced
- Able to move
- Ready to adjust
- Not overextended

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.4: ESCORTING TECHNIQUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of Escort:
- Moving person from A to B
- Usually toward exit
- With control
- Safely for all

Escort Principles:

MINIMUM FORCE:
- Sufficient to move them
- Not excessive
- Guide rather than drag
- Allow them to walk

DIRECTION OF TRAVEL:
- Clear where you're going
- Shortest safe route
- Away from hazards
- Toward exit

CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION:
- Tell them what's happening
- "Walk with me to the door"
- Reduces resistance
- Creates witnesses

WATCH FOR CHANGES:
- Compliance can change
- May try to escape
- May become more aggressive
- Reassess constantly

Two-Person Escort:
- One on each side
- Synchronized movement
- Communication between team
- One leads, one follows direction

Walking Pace:
- Normal walking pace
- Don't rush (trips, resistance)
- Don't dawdle (gives time to resist)
- Controlled, steady

At the Door:
- Don't push out aggressively
- Release hold
- Step back inside
- Close door/block entry
- Watch for return

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.5: TEAM RESTRAINT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Team Better Than Solo:
- Safer for everyone
- More effective control
- Witnesses to each other
- Can cover different areas
- Reduces injury risk

Ideal Team Sizes:
- 2 people: One each side, arm control
- 3 people: Two arms plus head/legs
- 4+ people: Additional leg control, observer

Role Division:

HEAD/UPPER BODY:
- Most important to control
- Controls direction
- Airway monitoring
- Communication with subject

LEFT ARM:
- Controls left arm
- Prevents grabbing/striking
- Coordinates with right arm

RIGHT ARM:
- Controls right arm
- Same as left
- Coordinated movement

LEGS:
- If subject kicking
- Prevents running
- May need two people
- Careful not to injure

OBSERVER:
- Monitors whole situation
- Checks breathing/condition
- Communicates with others
- Calls for help if needed
- Does not get involved in restraint

Coordination:
- Clear leader (usually head controller)
- Verbal signals
- "Ready... Move..."
- Synchronised actions
- Everyone knows their role

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.6: STANDING RESTRAINT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages:
- Person can breathe normally
- Less medical risk than ground
- Easier to move them
- More dignified

Challenges:
- Person can resist more
- Harder to control
- May fall
- Requires good technique

Key Points:

ARM CONTROL:
- Control at wrist and above elbow
- Keep arms away from body
- Bent arm is easier to control
- Watch for breaking free

POSITIONING:
- Stay to the side
- Hip-to-hip contact
- Can guide movement
- Feel their movements

CENTRE OF GRAVITY:
- Keep them slightly off-balance
- Your weight advantageous
- Can lower them if needed
- Control without excessive force

Communication:
- "If you calm down I can let go"
- Give them a way out
- Continuous reassurance
- Explain what's happening

Transition to Ground:
- Only if necessary
- If control being lost
- If danger increasing
- Controlled descent
- Protect head

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.7: GROUND RESTRAINT CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL: Ground Restraint Has Serious Risks

When Ground Restraint May Occur:
- Person taken to ground during struggle
- Standing restraint not working
- Person already on ground
- Transition from standing

Risks of Ground Restraint:

POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA:
- Face-down position restricts breathing
- Weight on back makes it worse
- Can be fatal
- Covered in detail in Chapter 4.5

INJURY RISK:
- Going to ground can cause injury
- Hard surfaces
- Objects on ground
- Joint injuries

LESS CONTROL:
- Harder to see their face
- Harder to monitor breathing
- Harder to communicate
- Harder to move them

If Ground Restraint Used:

NEVER FACE-DOWN FOR LONG:
- Maximum risk position
- Turn to side/recovery position ASAP
- Or seated/standing if possible

NO WEIGHT ON BACK:
- Restricts breathing
- No kneeling on back
- No lying across them
- Control limbs, not torso

MONITOR CONSTANTLY:
- Breathing
- Colour
- Consciousness
- Responsiveness
- Any deterioration = EMERGENCY

MINIMISE DURATION:
- As brief as possible
- Get them up when safe
- Or recovery position
- Don't leave face-down

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.8: HANDOVER TO POLICE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holding for Police:
- Lawful if arrest is lawful
- Must be proportionate
- Duration must be reasonable
- "As soon as practicable"

Before Police Arrive:
- Maintain restraint safely
- Monitor welfare constantly
- Keep talking to person
- Document what's happening
- Preserve evidence

When Police Arrive:

HANDOVER INFORMATION:
- What happened
- Why restrained
- How long restrained
- Any injuries
- Any medical concerns
- Witnesses

PHYSICAL HANDOVER:
- Wait for police to be ready
- Coordinate release
- Don't just let go suddenly
- Clear communication

AFTER HANDOVER:
- Police take responsibility
- Provide statement
- Preserve evidence
- Documentation

If Police Delayed:
- Reassess necessity of restraint
- Consider release if safe
- Monitor welfare closely
- Document decisions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.4.9: RELEASING RESTRAINT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to Release:

COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED:
- Person has calmed
- No longer threat
- Agrees to leave peacefully
- Force no longer necessary

HANDOVER COMPLETE:
- Police have control
- Another authority takes over
- Your role is done

SITUATION CHANGED:
