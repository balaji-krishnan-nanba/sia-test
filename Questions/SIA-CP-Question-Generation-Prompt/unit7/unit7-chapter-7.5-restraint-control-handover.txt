SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.5
RESTRAINT, CONTROL AND HANDOVER
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 21 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 7.5 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE UNIT
--------
Unit 7: Physical Intervention Skills for the Private Security Industry
- Assessment: 30 Multiple Choice Questions
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Pass Mark: 80% (24/30) - HIGHER THAN OTHER UNITS
- Chapters: 6
- Practice Questions: 124 total
- This chapter (7.5) is one of 6 chapters in Unit 7

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Once physical intervention has occurred, safe restraint and proper handover
to authorities are critical. Poor restraint technique can result in death
(positional asphyxia), and improper handover creates legal and professional
risks. The 80% pass mark reflects this critical knowledge.

UNIT 7, CHAPTER 7.5: RESTRAINT, CONTROL AND HANDOVER
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
Which ground position carries the HIGHEST risk of positional asphyxia?

A) Recovery position
B) Seated position
C) Supine (face up)
D) Prone (face down)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The PRONE (face down) position carries the HIGHEST risk of 
positional asphyxia. In this position, the body's weight can compress the 
chest and restrict breathing. If restraint in prone position is necessary, 
it must be for the minimum possible time, and the person should be moved 
to the recovery position as soon as safely possible.
