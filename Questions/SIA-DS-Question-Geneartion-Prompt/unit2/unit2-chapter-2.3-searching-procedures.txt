SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.3
SEARCHING PROCEDURES
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 25 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.3 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Door Supervisor
- 50 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 75 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (35 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.3) is one of 10 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Searching is a critical skill for door supervisors. However, it is also an 
area with significant legal risk. Door supervisors have NO statutory power 
to search - all searches must be based on CONSENT. Understanding this is 
essential to avoid assault charges and civil claims.

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 25

- Medium (application): 10 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 5 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.3.1: LEGAL BASIS FOR SEARCHES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Door supervisors have NO statutory power to search.

No Legal Power:
- Unlike police, door supervisors cannot legally demand a search
- No law gives door supervisors search powers
- Cannot force anyone to be searched
- Cannot detain someone for refusing search

Consent-Based Searches:
- ALL searches must be VOLUNTARY
- Based on customer's consent
- Customer must agree freely
- No pressure, coercion, or threats

Search as Condition of Entry:
- Venue can make search a condition of entry
- "No search, no entry" policy is lawful
- Customer can refuse search
- But venue can then refuse entry
- Customer's choice: consent to search or don't enter

Consent Principles:
- Must be FREELY given
- Must be INFORMED (person knows what they're agreeing to)
- Can be WITHDRAWN at any time
- If consent withdrawn: stop search immediately

Implied vs Explicit Consent:
- Implied: signs at entry, walking past search point
- Explicit: verbally agreeing to search
- Best practice: ask for explicit consent
- "Do you consent to being searched?"

What Happens if Search Refused:
- CANNOT force search
- CANNOT detain person
- CAN refuse entry to venue
- Person is free to leave
- Refusing search is NOT an offence

If You Search Without Consent:
- Assault / battery
- False imprisonment (if detained)
- Criminal charges possible
- Civil claim for damages
- Loss of SIA licence
