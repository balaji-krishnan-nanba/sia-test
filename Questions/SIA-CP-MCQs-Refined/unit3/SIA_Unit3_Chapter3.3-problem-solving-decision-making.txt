UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.3: PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING

Question 1 [Easy]
Which sequence correctly shows the stages of the SARA problem-solving model?

A) Scanning, Analysis, Response, Assessment
B) Scanning, Assessment, Response, Analysis
C) Situation, Analysis, Reaction, Assessment
D) Survey, Action, Review, Assessment

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
SARA is a four-stage problem-solving framework: Scanning, Analysis, Response, Assessment. CPOs use it to systematically work through conflict situations from identifying the problem through to reviewing how well their actions worked.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which action BEST reflects the principle of “speaking softly” when de-escalating conflict?

A) Giving rapid, detailed instructions in a firm, raised voice
B) Using a calm, quiet tone and slowing down your speech
C) Remaining completely silent and refusing to respond
D) Matching the other person’s volume so they feel understood

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
De-escalation involves lowering your voice and slowing down your speech to reduce tension. A calm tone and measured pace communicate control and safety, helping to calm the other person rather than inflame them.

Question 3 [Easy]
In a confrontation with an upset member of the public, “win–win thinking” in negotiation means:

A) Ensuring the principal clearly wins and the other party clearly loses
B) Avoiding any compromise and sticking to your first position
C) Seeking an outcome where both sides gain something acceptable
D) Ending the conversation as quickly as possible, regardless of the result

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Win–win thinking means both sides gain something they can accept. In CP, this might be the other person getting some information or reassurance, while the principal’s safety and privacy remain protected.

Question 4 [Easy]
In the Five-Step Appeal used in tactical communication, what is usually the FIRST step?

A) Offer options
B) Set context
C) Act
D) Ask

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
The Five-Step Appeal starts with a polite request – “Ask”. The CPO first asks the person to comply in a professional tone. Only if that fails do they move on to explaining, offering options, confirming and then acting.

Question 5 [Easy]
When dealing with an intoxicated individual who is becoming argumentative near the principal, which approach is MOST appropriate?

A) Use simple language, repeat key points if needed, and avoid arguing
B) Firmly confront their behaviour and threaten to involve police immediately
C) Challenge them with complex explanations so they realise they are wrong
D) Ignore them completely and hope they go away

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Intoxicated people often have impaired judgement and concentration. The best approach is simple, repeated communication, patience and not arguing. This reduces the risk of escalation while maintaining safety.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which of the following is the BEST example of using acknowledgement as a de-escalation technique?

A) “Calm down or I’ll have to remove you.”
B) “I can see this is really frustrating for you.”
C) “You shouldn’t be reacting like this.”
D) “There’s nothing I can do about it.”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Acknowledgement is about recognising the person’s feelings. Saying “I can see this is really frustrating for you” validates their emotions and helps to lower tension, even if you cannot give them what they want.

Question 7 [Easy]
In close protection, “command presence” mainly refers to:

A) Raising your voice so everyone can hear you
B) Standing as close as possible to the other person
C) A confident, professional demeanour that communicates calm authority
D) Displaying physical strength to intimidate others

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Command presence is about how you carry yourself – confident, calm, professional and in control. This reassures the principal and the public and can encourage compliance without needing aggression.

Question 8 [Easy]
When making decisions in a conflict situation as a CPO, what should ALWAYS be the first priority?

A) Protecting members of the public
B) Ensuring team members are not criticised after the event
C) Completing the mission exactly as agreed with the client
D) Maintaining the principal’s safety at all times

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
The decision-making priorities place principal safety first. Team safety, public safety, legal compliance and mission success are important, but they follow after the principal’s protection.

Question 9 [Medium]
At a large private event, you notice the same small group repeatedly blocking an access route and arguing with staff. You review CCTV and speak to staff to understand why they are angry and what triggers their behaviour. In SARA, which stage are you focusing on?

A) Analysis
B) Response
C) Assessment
D) Scanning

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The Analysis stage is about understanding why the problem is happening – root causes, patterns and motivations. Scanning identifies the problem; analysis digs into the “why” behind it.

Question 10 [Medium]
A member of the public is shouting aggressively at your team because a temporary barrier is delaying his vehicle. The principal is in a nearby car. What is the MOST appropriate initial de-escalation response?

A) Order him to move back and threaten arrest
B) Step to a safe distance, adopt an open stance, and calmly explain why the barrier is in place
C) Ignore him completely while continuing your task
D) Move directly towards him, pointing a finger to emphasise your instructions

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Effective de-escalation combines creating space, open body language and a calm explanation. This reduces threat, maintains safety for the principal and may resolve the issue without confrontation.

Question 11 [Medium]
A journalist insists on speaking directly to the principal at a hotel entrance. You say, “Help me understand what you actually need today – is it a statement, a photo, or confirmation they attended?” Which negotiation principle are you applying?

A) Separating people from the problem
B) Creative options
C) Understanding interests
D) Win–lose bargaining

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
By asking what the journalist really needs, you are focusing on understanding their underlying interests. Once you know what would satisfy them, you can look for safe alternatives that protect the principal.

Question 12 [Medium]
During a sudden crowd surge at an event, you feel your heart racing and your focus narrowing. Before making your next decision, you take slow breaths – in for four seconds, hold for four, out for four. In this moment you are primarily:

A) Gathering more information about the threat
B) Creating new negotiation options
C) Moving straight to physical intervention
D) Using a stress-management technique to regain control and think clearly

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
This is tactical breathing (4–4–4), a stress-management tool. It helps control the physical stress response, widen attention and support clearer problem solving under pressure.

Question 13 [Medium]
At a charity event, an agitated attendee keeps pushing towards the principal despite several warnings. After evaluating the risk, you decide to move the principal to a secure room and request venue security to contain the individual. Within SARA, this decision to put a plan into action is part of which stage?

A) Response
B) Scanning
C) Analysis
D) Assessment

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The Response stage is where you choose and implement a solution – here, moving the principal and using available resources (venue security) to manage the threat.

Question 14 [Medium]
At a corporate function, a calm, well-dressed guest keeps asking detailed questions about the principal’s movements and tests how close he can get to restricted areas. His behaviour suggests he is calculating rather than emotional. What is the MOST appropriate approach?

A) Match his confidence with humour and share some harmless details to keep him relaxed
B) Remain professional, set clear boundaries, and avoid being drawn into manipulation while maintaining heightened awareness
C) Ignore him completely so he loses interest in the principal
D) Immediately remove him using physical intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
A calculating individual is cold, controlled and testing. The correct approach is to stay professional, maintain firm boundaries and avoid being manipulated, while treating him as a potential higher-level threat.

Question 15 [Medium]
A protest forms unexpectedly near the venue exit. The Team Leader is briefly out of contact. You hesitate between two reasonably safe exit routes and lose several seconds trying to decide. Which statement best reflects the decision-making principle for CPOs in this situation?

A) Indecision is safer because it avoids responsibility for the outcome
B) It is always better to wait until you have all possible information before acting
C) Indecision can be worse than making an imperfect but timely decision, because delay can allow the situation to worsen
D) Changing a plan after acting is never acceptable in close protection

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
In dynamic situations, indecision can create more risk than an imperfect but timely decision. CPOs should act based on the best information available, then adjust as required rather than freezing.

Question 16 [Medium]
An upset guest shouts, “Your team are rude and you’re blocking everything!” Which reply BEST demonstrates paraphrasing as a tactical communication skill?

A) “That’s not true, we’re just doing our job.”
B) “Calm down, there’s nothing to be upset about.”
C) “If you don’t move back, we will remove you.”
D) “So you feel we’re being rude and making it hard for people to get through, is that right?”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Paraphrasing means restating the person’s message in your own words to show understanding and check accuracy. Option D reflects their concern back to them and can help de-escalate the situation.

Question 17 [Hard]
After a confrontation outside a venue, your team moved the principal to safety and police removed the aggressor. Back at the residence, you review CCTV, compare radio logs, discuss what worked, and update the advance plan to prevent a similar incident. In SARA, this activity is mainly part of which stage?

A) Assessment
B) Response
C) Scanning
D) Analysis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The Assessment stage focuses on evaluating effectiveness – did the response work, what actually happened, and what lessons can be learned. Updating plans to prevent recurrence is a key part of this stage.

Question 18 [Hard]
Outside a nightclub, an intoxicated man is aggressively demanding a photo with the principal. You have used a calm voice, empathy statements and offered alternative options, but his behaviour is becoming more unpredictable and he is moving closer to the principal. Which action BEST reflects recognising the limits of de-escalation while maintaining the principal’s safety?

A) Continue repeating the same calming phrases in the hope he eventually gives up
B) Increase the distance between him and the principal, prepare the team for escalation, and be ready to withdraw the principal if needed
C) Immediately shout at him to shock him into compliance
D) Allow the photo quickly so that he will leave

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
De-escalation has limits. When it is no longer working and risk is increasing, the CPO must change strategy – create distance, prepare for escalation, and prioritise withdrawal or containment to protect the principal.

Question 19 [Hard]
At a hotel entrance, a small group of disgruntled former employees demand “two minutes” with the principal and are attracting media attention. The principal must leave shortly for an important meeting, but the group currently poses no immediate physical threat. Which negotiation strategy is MOST appropriate?

A) Tell them bluntly the principal will never speak to them and order them to leave immediately
B) Allow them to approach the principal briefly so they feel heard and leave
C) Acknowledge their concerns, clarify what they really want, and propose an alternative such as passing a written statement or arranging contact through the principal’s office later
D) Ignore them completely while moving the principal past without any communication

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Option C applies several negotiation principles: acknowledgement, understanding interests, and creative options. It protects the principal’s safety and schedule while offering an alternative route for the group to be heard.

Question 20 [Hard]
During a public walkabout, a supporter suddenly rushes towards the principal and is restrained by your team without injury. The subject has been handed over to police and the immediate threat is over. What should be your FIRST priority in the immediate post-conflict phase?

A) Begin writing a detailed incident report while events are fresh
B) Debrief the team to identify what worked and what went wrong
C) Speak with venue management about improving crowd barriers for future events
D) Check on the principal’s physical safety and emotional state, ensuring they are secure and have what they need

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Immediately after a conflict, the principal’s safety and wellbeing remain the first priority. Only after confirming they are safe and supported should the CPO move on to reporting, debrief and wider learning.
