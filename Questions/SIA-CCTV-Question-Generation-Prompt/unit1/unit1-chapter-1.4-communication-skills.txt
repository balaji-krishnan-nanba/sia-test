--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.3: THE PHONETIC ALPHABET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Use Phonetic Alphabet:
- Clarity over radio
- Avoids confusion
- Standard across agencies
- Essential for spelling names, registration numbers

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet:

A - Alpha          N - November
B - Bravo          O - Oscar
C - Charlie        P - Papa
D - Delta          Q - Quebec
E - Echo           R - Romeo
F - Foxtrot        S - Sierra
G - Golf           T - Tango
H - Hotel          U - Uniform
I - India          V - Victor

When to Use:

(for AB12 CDE)

Numbers:

- "One" not "won"
- "Nine" not "niner" (UK)
- Each digit separately for registrations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.4: PROVIDING DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Descriptions Matter for CCTV:
- Police need to find the person
- Accurate description = successful response
- Poor description = wrong person stopped
- Evidence for later identification

Description Structure (top to bottom):

1. SEX:
   - Male/Female/Unknown

2. ETHNICITY/APPEARANCE:
   - IC codes (Identity Codes) still used
   - IC1: White - North European
   - IC2: White - South European
   - IC3: Black
   - IC4: Asian (South Asian)
   - IC5: Chinese/Japanese/Southeast Asian
   - IC6: Arabic/North African

3. AGE (approximate):
   - Teenager, 20s, 30s, etc.
   - Or age range "25-35"

4. HEIGHT:
   - Estimate in feet/inches or metres

5. BUILD:
   - Slim, medium, heavy, muscular

6. HAIR:
   - Colour, length, style

   - Shoes
   - Colours and distinctive features

8. DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:

CCTV Description Challenges:
- Camera angle affects view
- Lighting conditions
- Distance from camera
- Hat/hood obscuring face
- Movement blur
- Only describe what you CAN see

Example Description:
"Male, IC1, approximately 30 years old, 5'10", medium build, 
short brown hair, wearing black hooded top, blue jeans, white 
trainers, carrying a rucksack, heading west on Market Street"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.5: GIVING DIRECTIONS AND LOCATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Location Accuracy Matters:
- Responders need to find incident
- Wrong location = delayed response
- Multiple cameras = multiple locations
- Street names, landmarks essential

- Be specific (outside number 23, not "High Street")

Using Landmarks:

- Junctions
- Bus stops
- Distinctive features

Direction of Travel:
