CHAPTER 4.2: ATTACK METHODOLOGIES - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 22
- Easy (direct recall): 9 questions
- Medium (application): 9 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.2.1: THE HOSTILE PLANNING CYCLE (ATTACK CYCLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding the Attack Cycle:
- Terrorists plan methodically
- Attacks rarely spontaneous
- Follows identifiable stages
- Intervention possible at each stage
- Early detection prevents attacks

The Six Stages:

1. TARGET SELECTION:
   - Research potential targets
   - Identify vulnerabilities
   - Match to objectives
   - Assess feasibility
   - Choose final target

2. SURVEILLANCE/RECONNAISSANCE:
   - Observe target
   - Gather information
   - Identify patterns
   - Map security measures
   - Multiple visits possible

3. PLANNING:
   - Develop attack plan
   - Acquire resources
   - Assign roles
   - Set timeline
   - Identify escape routes

4. DEPLOYMENT:
   - Move into position
   - Final preparation
   - Last reconnaissance
   - Equipment ready
   - Point of no return approaching

5. ATTACK:
   - Execute plan
   - Carry out violence
   - May be brief or prolonged
   - Multiple methods possible

6. ESCAPE:
   - Flee scene
   - Evade capture
   - Not always planned
   - May include suicide

Disrupting the Cycle:

AT TARGET SELECTION:

================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What does VBIED stand for?

A) Very Big Improvised Explosive Device
B) Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device
C) Victim-Based Improvised Explosive Device
D) Visual Bomb Identification and Evaluation Device

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: VBIED stands for Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device - 
a bomb placed in or constructed within a vehicle. VBIEDs can carry large 
amounts of explosives and are particularly dangerous as vehicles can 
breach security cordons and approach close to targets.

KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

HOSTILE PLANNING CYCLE (6 stages):
1. Target Selection
2. Surveillance/Reconnaissance
3. Planning
4. Deployment
5. Attack
6. Escape

IED TYPES:
- VBIED = Vehicle-Borne IED
- PBIED = Person-Borne IED (suicide bomber)
- UCIED = Under-Vehicle IED
- Package/Object IED
- Letter/Mail bomb

HOT PROTOCOL (suspicious items):
- H = Has it been HIDDEN?
- O = Is it OBVIOUSLY suspicious?
- T = Is it TYPICAL for this location?

RUN-HIDE-TELL (firearms/terrorism):
- RUN = Evacuate immediately
- HIDE = If cannot run, find cover
- TELL = When safe, call 999

COVER vs CONCEALMENT:
- Cover = stops bullets (physical protection)
- Concealment = hides from view only (visual)

VEHICLE ATTACK RESPONSE:
- Move PERPENDICULAR to threat
- Seek solid cover
- Evacuate area

SURVEILLANCE INDICATORS:
- Unusual observation
- Photography/filming
- Repeated sightings
- Questions about security

IF IED SUSPECTED:
- DO NOT touch
- DO NOT use radio near it
- Clear area
- Report immediately

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- PBIED is package-borne (wrong - person-borne)
- Concealment stops bullets (wrong - that's cover)
- First stage is surveillance (wrong - target selection)
- Run toward gunfire to help (wrong - run away)
- Radio safe near suspected IED (wrong - don't use radio)

================================================================================
CLOSE PROTECTION SCENARIOS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

Use these scenario types in questions:

- "What is the first stage of the hostile planning cycle?"
- "A CPO discovers a suspicious package. Using HOT protocol..."
- "What does PBIED stand for?"
- "During a firearms attack, the first action should be..."
- "The difference between cover and concealment is..."
- "Which of the following is a pre-attack indicator?"
- "When responding to a vehicle attack, the principal should be moved..."
