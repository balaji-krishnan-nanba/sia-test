It is granted by the local licensing authority and includes an operating schedule, plans, hours and conditions.

Question 4 [Easy]
Who is the Designated Premises Supervisor (DPS) at alcohol-licensed premises?

A) The most senior police officer for the area
B) Any SIA-licensed door supervisor working that night
C) The local authority licensing officer
D) The personal licence holder named on the premises licence with day-to-day responsibility for alcohol sales

GOV.UK
+2
Sheffield City Council
+2

Door supervisors work under the DPS’s authority and should report licensing concerns to them or to management.

Question 5 [Easy]
Under a Challenge 25 age verification policy, what should a door supervisor do when someone who appears to be under 25 wants to enter to drink alcohol?

A) Ask for acceptable photo ID proving they are 18 or over and refuse entry if they cannot provide it
B) Let them in as long as they are with an older friend
C) Ask their date of birth and accept their verbal answer
D) Only ask for ID if they try to buy alcohol at the bar

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Challenge 25 means anyone who appears under 25 must be asked for acceptable ID before they buy or consume alcohol; if they cannot prove they are 18 or over, the sale or entry for drinking must be refused.

This helps prevent underage sales and supports the “protection of children from harm” licensing objective.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which of the following is an acceptable form of ID for proving age in a licensed venue?

A) Student ID card
B) Passport
C) Bank card with the customer’s name
D) Gym membership card

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Commonly accepted forms of ID include a valid passport, photocard driving licence, a PASS-accredited proof-of-age card and military ID. 
kent.police.uk
+1

Student cards, bank cards and similar documents are not normally acceptable because they are easy to fake and may not show date of birth clearly.

Question 7 [Easy]
Which of the following is a specific offence under licensing law?

A) Refusing entry to a drunk person
B) Serving free tap water to a drunk person
C) Knowingly selling alcohol to a person who is drunk
D) Asking a drunk customer to leave the premises

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Section 141 of the Licensing Act 2003 makes it an offence to knowingly sell or attempt to sell alcohol to a person who is drunk, or to knowingly allow such a sale. 
Freeths

Door supervisors help prevent such offences by refusing entry to obviously drunk customers and supporting bar staff decisions to stop service.

Question 8 [Easy]
Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cocaine is classified as which class of drug?

A) Class D
B) Class B
C) Class C
D) Class A

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Cocaine is a Class A controlled drug, along with substances such as heroin, ecstasy and LSD. 
GOV.UK
+2
Legislation.gov.uk
+2

Class A drugs carry the most serious penalties for possession and supply, so any suspected use or dealing in a venue must be taken extremely seriously.

Question 9 [Medium]
Local residents repeatedly complain about loud music and customers shouting outside a late-night bar. Which licensing objective is most directly concerned with this issue?

A) Prevention of public nuisance
B) Public safety
C) Prevention of crime and disorder
D) Protection of children from harm

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Noise from music, customers leaving the premises, litter and other disturbances to neighbours fall mainly under the prevention of public nuisance objective. 
liverpoolscp.trixonline.co.uk
+1

Door supervisors contribute by managing queues and dispersal, controlling noise at the door and encouraging customers to leave quietly.

Question 10 [Medium]
The premises licence for a nightclub states that a minimum of two SIA-licensed door supervisors must be on duty from 21:00 until closing on Friday and Saturday. At 22:30, you are the only door supervisor on duty because your colleague has called in sick. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Continue working alone but stand inside the doorway so you are safer
B) Inform management immediately, try to arrange additional cover, and restrict or stop entry if the condition cannot be met
C) Ignore the licence condition because staffing levels are the manager’s responsibility
D) Ask a member of bar staff to stand at the door instead of a licensed door supervisor

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Licence conditions are legally binding; breaching them is a criminal offence and can lead to fines, imprisonment and review of the licence. 
GOV.UK
+2
southlakeland.gov.uk
+2

Door supervisors must alert management and support compliance—for example by arranging extra cover and limiting entry until the required number of SIA-licensed staff is on duty.

Question 11 [Medium]
Who normally needs to hold a personal licence in a bar or nightclub?

A) Every member of bar staff who serves alcohol
B) All SIA-licensed door supervisors
C) Individuals who supervise or authorise the sale of alcohol, such as the DPS
D) Any customer who regularly buys alcohol in the premises

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
A personal licence authorises an individual to sell or authorise the sale of alcohol. Not every server needs one, but every sale must be made by or under the authority of a personal licence holder, typically the DPS or managers.

Question 12 [Medium]
A charity wants to run a one-night music event with a pay bar for 350 people in a village hall that does not have a premises licence. The event will run from 18:00 to midnight. What is the most appropriate form of authorisation?

A) Club Premises Certificate
B) Personal Licence
C) Full Premises Licence for the hall only for that day
D) Temporary Event Notice (TEN)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:

GOV.UK
+2
Hertsmere Borough Council

It is ideal for occasional events in premises that do not have a permanent premises licence, like a village hall.

Question 13 [Medium]
You are working the door at a bar that operates Challenge 25. A customer who looks about 19 arrives with friends and says, “I forgot my ID, but I’m definitely 19.” What should you do?

A) Politely refuse entry for drinking alcohol, explain the policy, and record the refusal if required
B) Ask them their date of birth and let them in if they answer correctly
C) Let them in as long as they promise not to cause trouble
D) Ask an older friend in the group to confirm their age

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Under Challenge 25, if someone appears under 25 you must see acceptable ID before allowing them to buy or consume alcohol; if they cannot provide it, you must refuse.

Recording refusals helps demonstrate due diligence if the police or licensing authority investigate.

Question 14 [Medium]
Inside a venue you are protecting, you notice a customer who is very unsteady on their feet, slurring their speech and bumping into other people. What is the best course of action in line with licensing objectives and your duty of care?

A) Ignore the behaviour unless a fight starts
B) Stop further alcohol service, monitor them, and arrange for them to leave safely with friends or suitable transport, calling medical help if needed
C) Immediately drag them outside and leave them on the pavement
D) Offer them a free strong drink so they “calm down”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
It is an offence to knowingly sell alcohol to someone who is drunk, and venues must manage the safety of customers affected by alcohol. 
Freeths
+2
GOV.UK
+2

Door supervisors should support refusal of further alcohol, monitor the person’s condition, arrange safe exit and get medical help if there are any concerns (for example, risk of alcohol poisoning).

Question 15 [Medium]
On the door of a club, you see the same man repeatedly going outside, speaking briefly to different people, and appearing to pass small packets in exchange for money. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Search him yourself and keep any drugs you find to hand over “later” if necessary
B) Ignore it as long as no one complains
C) Inform management, follow the venue’s search and drugs policy, and involve the police where drug dealing is suspected
D) Allow him to continue but warn him not to be so obvious

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 makes possession and supply of controlled drugs criminal offences, and it is an offence for those in control of premises to knowingly allow drug use or supply. 
Legislation.gov.uk
+2
National Pubwatch
+2

Door supervisors should follow the venue’s agreed drugs policy—this typically includes informing management, conducting searches with consent, seizing suspected drugs in line with policy, recording the incident and notifying police.

Question 16 [Medium]
Following serious disorder linked to a nightclub, the police use closure powers so the premises must shut immediately for a period. What is the most likely next step in terms of licensing?

A) No further action once the closure period ends
B) The DPS automatically loses their personal licence
C) All door supervisors automatically lose their SIA licences
D) The premises licence will usually be reviewed by the licensing authority and could face extra conditions, suspension or revocation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
When a closure order is made, the Licensing Act 2003 provides for a review of the premises licence within a set period (typically within 28 days), where conditions may be added, the licence suspended or revoked. 
Legislation.gov.uk
+2
Huntingdonshire.gov.uk

Good documentation and professional conduct by door supervisors can be vital evidence that the venue is trying to uphold the licensing objectives.

Question 17 [Hard]
You are working at a live music venue that serves alcohol. A group arrives: one customer shows a valid passport proving they are 22. Their friend looks clearly under 18 and has no ID. The older friend says, “It’s fine, I’ll buy all the drinks and pass them to him, he won’t go near the bar.” What is the most appropriate response?

A) Refuse entry for the underage person and explain that buying alcohol for them would be illegal, but allow the 22‑year‑old in if appropriate
B) Allow both in as long as the younger friend promises not to approach the bar
C) Allow both in but tell the older friend not to get the younger one “too drunk”
D) Refuse entry to the whole group and immediately call the police

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
It is an offence to sell alcohol to someone under 18 and also an offence for an adult to purchase alcohol on behalf of a person under 18 (a proxy sale). 
Legislation.gov.uk
+2
Sentencing Council
+2

Allowing the younger person in where the stated intention is that they will drink alcohol would undermine the “protection of children from harm” objective. Refusing entry to the underage person while explaining the law and policy is proportionate and professional.

Question 18 [Hard]
At the entrance, a customer agrees to a bag search (as clearly advertised on signage). You find a small wrap of white powder which you reasonably suspect is an illegal drug. The customer appears calm and there is no immediate safety risk. What should you do next, in line with good practice?

A) Hand the drugs straight back after warning them
B) Follow the venue’s drug policy: confiscate the suspected drugs, secure them in a suitable container, notify management and arrange for them to be handed to the police, recording all details
C) Immediately flush the drugs down the toilet so no one gets into trouble
D) Keep the drugs in your own locker until you decide what to do with them

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Licensed premises should have a clear drugs policy (often agreed with police) covering searches, seizure, storage and recording of suspected drugs, with arrangements for regular collection by police. 
Safer Nightlife
+2
NTIA Night-Time Industry
+2

Door supervisors should never keep seized drugs personally or dispose of them secretly; secure handling and accurate records protect both the venue and the staff.

Question 19 [Hard]
You are head door supervisor at a nightclub. The premises licence states a maximum capacity of 400 people. Your clicker shows 402 people inside. The manager tells you: “Keep letting them in, we can’t afford to turn people away.” What is the best course of action?

A) Continue admitting customers until the manager tells you to stop
B) Switch off or reset your clicker so there is no record of the numbers
C) Stop further admissions immediately, explain to the manager that you cannot exceed the licensed capacity, and record the incident in the venue log, escalating to the DPS or company if necessary
D) Keep admitting customers but open fire exits to reduce overcrowding

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Capacity limits are often licence conditions linked to public safety (fire safety and overcrowding). Breaching licence conditions is a criminal offence and can result in large fines, imprisonment and licence review. 
southlakeland.gov.uk

wigan.gov.uk
+2

Door supervisors must support compliance, not hide breaches. Stopping entry, documenting the issue and escalating to the DPS/company protects both safety and your professional position.

Question 20 [Hard]
During a busy Saturday night, a police sergeant and a local authority licensing officer arrive at the door and say they wish to enter immediately to check compliance with the premises licence and view CCTV footage. Licensable activities are taking place. What is your legal duty as a door supervisor?

A) Refuse entry unless they show a magistrates’ search warrant
B) Allow the police in but refuse the licensing officer because they are not police
C) Only allow them in if the DPS arrives and agrees
D) Allow both authorised officers access to the premises and provide reasonable assistance, as obstructing their lawful entry is an offence

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Under the Licensing Act 2003, police officers and authorised persons (including licensing authority officers) have powers of entry to premises being used for licensable activities; intentionally obstructing them is a criminal offence.

Door supervisors must cooperate, allow access and assist professionally while continuing to maintain safety and order at the entrance.
