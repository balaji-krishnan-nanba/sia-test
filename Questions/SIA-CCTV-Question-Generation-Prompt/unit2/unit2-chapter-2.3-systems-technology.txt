Question 1 [Easy]
What does PTZ stand for in relation to CCTV cameras?

A) Precision Targeting Zone
B) Pan-Tilt-Zoom
C) Programmable Tracking Zone
D) Power Transmission Zero

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: PTZ stands for Pan-Tilt-Zoom. Pan refers to horizontal movement 
(left/right), Tilt refers to vertical movement (up/down), and Zoom refers 
to the ability to magnify the image. PTZ cameras are operator-controlled 
and can cover wide areas.
