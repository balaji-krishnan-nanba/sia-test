UNIT 1, CHAPTER 1.4: THREAT ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the FIRST stage of the Hostile Planning Cycle?
A) Planning
B) Target selection
C) Attack
D) Surveillance/Reconnaissance
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The hostile planning cycle begins with target selection, where the attacker chooses who or what to attack based on value, accessibility and vulnerability. Only after choosing the target will they move on to surveillance, planning and later stages such as deployment, attack and escape.

Question 2 [Easy]
Within the UK terrorism threat level system, which level indicates that an attack is possible but not likely?
A) Severe – an attack is highly likely
B) Low – an attack is highly unlikely
C) Substantial – an attack is likely
D) Moderate – an attack is possible but not likely
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
In the UK system, MODERATE means an attack is possible but not likely, sitting above LOW and below SUBSTANTIAL, SEVERE and CRITICAL.

Question 3 [Easy]
A former partner has fixated on your principal, sends repeated messages and turns up at several venues where they appear. This is BEST described as which type of threat?
A) Situational threat
B) Directed threat
C) Incidental threat
D) Opportunistic threat
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A directed threat is specifically aimed at the principal, often motivated by personal grievance or obsession. Opportunistic and incidental threats are not personally targeted, whereas this former partner is clearly focused on the principal.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which of the following BEST represents the concept of risk in close protection?
A) Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
B) Risk = Threat + Impact
C) Risk = Vulnerability ÷ Impact
D) Risk = Threat × Likelihood only
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
In this context, risk is understood as the combination of a threat, the vulnerability it can exploit and the impact if it succeeds. Expressed simply, Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact, helping CPOs prioritise which issues need the most attention.

Question 5 [Easy]
Which situation MOST clearly increases the principal’s vulnerability through predictability?
A) The principal insists on leaving home at 08:00 every weekday using the same vehicle and the same route.
B) The principal travels frequently by commercial airline.
C) The principal attends a variety of charity events each year.
D) The principal gives occasional live TV interviews.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Repeating the same route at the same time every day creates a predictable pattern that hostile actors can study and exploit. The other options increase profile or exposure, but they are not as directly predictable as a fixed daily routine.

Question 6 [Easy]
Which statement BEST describes protective intelligence in a close protection context?
A) Information collected only after an attack to support investigations.
B) Information that is kept solely for law enforcement and never shared with the protection team.
C) Any rumours or gossip about the principal shared within the team.
D) Information gathered and analysed to identify, assess and manage potential threats before they materialise.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Protective intelligence is a proactive process—collecting and analysing information to identify threats early and feed into threat and risk assessments. It should be shared appropriately with the team and relevant partners so that protective measures can be adjusted in time.

Question 7 [Easy]
Your principal plans to visit a nightclub in an area with frequent violent incidents. After your advice, they decide not to go at all. Which risk mitigation strategy does this MOST clearly demonstrate?
A) Avoidance
B) Reduction
C) Transfer
D) Acceptance
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Avoidance means not doing the activity that carries the risk—here, the visit is cancelled entirely. Reduction would involve still going but with extra security; transfer might involve insurance; acceptance is agreeing to live with the risk.

Question 8 [Easy]
Dynamic risk assessment is BEST described as:
A) A planning meeting held once before each major event.
B) A continuous, real-time assessment of changing risks during an operation.
C) A legal document completed only by senior management.
D) A one-off written assessment produced at the start of a contract.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Dynamic risk assessment is the ongoing, real-time process of observing, assessing, deciding and acting as situations change. It complements formal written assessments by allowing the team to react quickly to new information or threats.

Question 9 [Easy]
In the Hostile Planning Cycle, during which stage is an attacker MOST likely to watch the principal’s routines and security measures from a distance?
A) Planning
B) Escape
C) Deployment
D) Surveillance/Reconnaissance
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
During surveillance/reconnaissance, hostile actors observe the target’s routines, security posture, routes and vulnerabilities. Detecting or disrupting surveillance at this stage is one of the best opportunities to prevent an attack.

Question 10 [Easy]
Which UK threat level indicates that a terrorist attack is highly likely?
A) Critical
B) Severe
C) Substantial
D) Moderate
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
In the UK system, SEVERE means an attack is highly likely, one step below CRITICAL. SUBSTANTIAL means an attack is likely, while MODERATE means possible but not likely.

Question 11 [Easy]
Which of the following is MOST typical of a lone actor threat?
A) An individual acting largely alone, driven by personal grievance or fixation, making behaviour harder to predict.
B) Attack planned and directed by a hostile government.
C) A group motivated purely by financial profit.
D) A large team using complex logistics and financing.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Lone actors often operate independently, driven by personal grievance, ideology or mental health issues. They can be hard to detect because they may not communicate or coordinate with a wider group.

Question 12 [Medium]
During an advance visit, you notice the same van parked near your principal’s office on several days, with occupants taking notes when the principal arrives and leaves. Which stage of the Hostile Planning Cycle does this MOST likely indicate?
A) Surveillance/Reconnaissance
B) Deployment
C) Target selection
D) Attack
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Repeated observation of routines and security measures strongly suggests the surveillance/reconnaissance stage. At this stage, counter‑surveillance and reporting can be used to disrupt the hostile plan.

Question 13 [Medium]
The principal’s diary of public engagements, including exact venues and times, is published on their website months in advance and rarely changes. Which vulnerability factor is MOST increased by this practice?
A) Profile
B) Predictability
C) Exposure
D) Access
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Publishing fixed times and venues far in advance makes the principal’s movements highly predictable, giving hostile actors time to plan. It also affects profile and exposure, but predictability is the primary vulnerability here.

Question 14 [Medium]
An event cannot be cancelled, but the CPO increases the team size, introduces bag searches and metal detectors, and sets up vehicle standoff distances. Which risk mitigation strategy is being applied MOST directly?
A) Reduction
B) Transfer
C) Acceptance
D) Avoidance
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
These are all risk reduction measures aimed at lowering the likelihood and/or impact of an attack while still allowing the event to go ahead. The risk is not avoided or transferred; some residual risk will still be accepted.

Question 15 [Medium]
Which of the following is the BEST example of open‑source protective intelligence?
A) Monitoring public social media posts and news articles for hostile comments or doxxing of the principal.
B) A confidential briefing from the local police regarding extremist activity.
C) Information from hotel security about a suspicious guest who asked about your principal.
D) The principal’s PA sharing details of a threatening letter sent privately to the office.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Open‑source intelligence (OSINT) is gathered from publicly available sources such as media and social media. Police briefings, private letters and internal security reports are important, but they are not open source.

Question 16 [Medium]
On the morning of a high‑profile rally, the UK national threat level is raised to CRITICAL. What does this level indicate?
A) An attack is possible but not likely.
B) An attack is highly likely in the near future, requiring immediate, maximum protective measures.
C) An attack has already taken place and there is no further risk.
D) An attack is likely at some point, but there is no specific concern.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
CRITICAL is the highest UK threat level and means an attack is highly likely in the near future, so the security posture should be at its maximum and immediate protective action is required.

Question 17 [Medium]
While driving the principal to a meeting, you encounter an unannounced protest that blocks your planned route. Tension is rising and objects are being thrown. According to dynamic risk assessment principles, what should you do FIRST?
A) Reverse back at speed, regardless of traffic conditions, to get away as quickly as possible.
B) Stop in a safe position, reassess the situation and alternative routes, and agree a new plan with the team before moving.
C) Order the driver to push slowly through the crowd using the vehicle as a shield.
D) Ask the principal what they would like to do and follow their preference without further assessment.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Dynamic risk assessment starts with observing and assessing the new situation before deciding and acting. Stopping in a safe position to reassess risks and routes protects the principal while avoiding rash decisions.

Question 18 [Medium]
When carrying out a structured written risk assessment for a new principal, which step should come IMMEDIATELY BEFORE you implement specific security countermeasures?
A) Communicate the agreed security plan to the principal.
B) Evaluate the overall level of risk for each threat using a risk matrix.
C) Assess the potential impact if each threat materialises.
D) Review how effective existing countermeasures have been.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The typical sequence is: identify threats and vulnerabilities, assess likelihood and impact, then evaluate risk using a matrix. Only after evaluating risk should you select and implement appropriate countermeasures.

Question 19 [Medium]
Your monitoring reveals a social media account posting detailed threats against the principal, including dates and venues that match their schedule. What is the MOST appropriate way to treat this information?
A) Record the posts as protective intelligence, assess credibility, update the risk assessment, and share with law enforcement and the team as appropriate.
B) Ignore it unless the person actually appears at an event.
C) Reply from the principal’s account warning the person to stop.
D) Print the posts and keep them on file without informing anyone until the next scheduled review.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
This is potential protective intelligence that must be documented, analysed and fed into the threat and risk assessments. Sharing relevant details with law enforcement and the team supports preventative action and planning.

Question 20 [Medium]
Your principal is shopping in a city centre when a large political protest turns violent nearby. The principal is not the focus of the protest, but there is a real risk of getting caught up in clashes. How is this BEST described?
A) Incidental threat, where the principal may suffer harm as a by‑product of wider disorder.
B) Opportunistic threat
C) Situational threat from a lone actor
D) Directed threat
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The principal is not being specifically targeted; they risk harm because they are near a wider violent incident. This is an incidental threat, being caught up in events aimed at others.

Question 21 [Medium]
New intelligence suggests a heightened risk at a planned walkabout. You advise the principal to shorten the route and increase separation from the crowd. How should you communicate this recommendation?
A) Emphasise worst‑case scenarios in dramatic language to ensure the principal agrees.
B) Avoid discussing the risks so as not to worry the principal and simply change the plan on the day.
C) Explain clearly and concisely what has changed, the specific risks, and your recommended adjustments, offering practical alternatives while avoiding unnecessary alarm.
D) Present the changes as non‑negotiable ‘orders’ that the principal must follow.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Risk should be communicated to the principal in a clear, professional and proportionate way, offering actionable advice and alternatives without causing unnecessary panic.

Question 22 [Medium]
Which measure would MOST directly disrupt the surveillance stage of the Hostile Planning Cycle against your principal’s residence?
A) Improving the escape routes from the residence to a safe house.
B) Conducting regular, planned counter‑surveillance around the residence to detect, record and challenge suspicious observers.
C) Purchasing an armoured vehicle for the principal.
D) Providing additional medical kits inside the house.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Counter‑surveillance specifically targets hostile surveillance by identifying and deterring those watching the principal. Armoured vehicles, medical kits and escape routes are useful, but they do not directly interfere with hostile observation.

Question 23 [Hard]
At the end of a gala event, the principal is about to exit via the main entrance. You notice a small group near the door who were also present earlier outside the hotel and at a restaurant, apparently filming only when the principal appeared. One individual now moves purposefully towards the exit with a hand inside their bag. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action for the team leader?
A) Continue with the planned exit but speed up the principal’s movement through the entrance.
B) Trigger the building’s fire alarm so everyone, including the principal, evacuates through the same exit.
C) Halt the principal in a secure internal area, alert the team and venue security, and switch to a safer exit plan (such as an alternative route or vehicle pickup) while the potential threat is assessed.
D) Walk over alone to question the group while the principal waits near the door.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Dynamic risk assessment prioritises principal safety. Stopping the principal in a secure area and changing the exit plan manages the threat while maintaining control. Approaching the group or forcing everyone through the same exit could increase danger.

Question 24 [Hard]
Your principal insists on travelling in an open‑top car along a predictable, publicised route during a period when the national threat level is SUBSTANTIAL and intelligence indicates possible interest from a hostile group. You cannot persuade them to cancel the event. Which approach BEST manages the risk?
A) Refuse to support the event and walk away from the task.
B) Accept the principal’s wishes and make no changes, as the risk cannot be eliminated anyway.
C) Take out additional insurance to cover any incident involving the principal.
D) Negotiate modifications: use a more secure vehicle configuration, vary timings and exact routing where possible, increase team strength and counter‑surveillance, and clearly document the advice given and the principal’s decision to proceed.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
With SUBSTANTIAL (attack likely) and specific interest, you should combine risk reduction (stronger vehicle, route/timing changes, extra resources) with documented acceptance of residual risk by the principal. Insurance alone does not protect life, and simply walking away does not fulfil professional duties if you can still make the event safer.

Question 25 [Hard]
Over several weeks you collect the following information:
Hotel staff report a guest asking detailed questions about the principal’s suite and movements.
Online forums contain posts analysing the principal’s travel patterns.
The principal’s office logs a series of anonymous, hostile phone calls.
How should a professional CPO treat this overall?
A) Deal with each item separately and only record incidents that involve direct contact with the principal.
B) Treat the calls as harmless unless a specific date for an attack is mentioned.
C) Rely solely on police to decide if the information is significant and take no internal action.
D) Collate all the information as protective intelligence, assess links and patterns, update the threat and risk assessments, and share relevant findings with the team and police as appropriate.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Protective intelligence involves collating and analysing all relevant information to look for patterns and escalation. This combined picture should then feed directly into threat and risk assessments and be shared appropriately.

Question 26 [Hard]
Intelligence indicates that a rival company has hired a criminal gang to kidnap your corporate principal for ransom. The group has carried out structured surveillance on the principal’s commute and has obtained details of their regular vehicle and driver. Which statement BEST describes this situation?
A) An incidental threat arising from civil disorder unrelated to the principal.
B) A purely situational threat created by environmental hazards.
C) A directed threat from an organised group motivated by financial gain.
D) An opportunistic threat from a lone actor with no planning.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
This is a directed threat (the principal is specifically targeted) from an organised group (criminal gang) with clear financial motivation (kidnap for ransom) and evidence of planning and surveillance.

Question 27 [Hard]
During a security review you identify the following issues:
The principal’s home address appears in several online articles.
The school run for the principal’s children uses the same route and timings every weekday, with minimal escort.
Late‑night meetings are held inside a secure office building with access control and CCTV.
The principal’s social media posts are delayed by 24 hours and managed by a professional team.
Which issue represents the MOST serious vulnerability that should be prioritised for action?
A) The late‑night meetings in the secure office building.
B) The predictable school run with limited protection.
C) The home address appearing online.
D) The delayed, managed social media postings.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The predictable school run combines high emotional impact, predictable timings and limited protection, making it an extremely attractive target. The home address being online is a concern, but without the daily predictable movement it is less immediately exploitable.

Question 28 [Hard]
After a detailed risk assessment you advise the principal to cancel a public appearance due to specific, credible threats. The principal refuses and insists on continuing. From a professional close protection perspective, what is the BEST course of action?
A) Re‑state your professional advice, clearly explain the risks and alternative options, document the advice and the principal’s decision, and implement additional practicable measures to reduce the residual risk.
B) Comply without further discussion; the principal’s decision is final and needs no record.
C) Threaten to withdraw protection immediately unless the principal follows your recommendation.
D) Ignore the threat assessment and treat the event as routine so the principal is not alarmed.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The CPO must give clear professional advice, ensure the principal is informed, and document both the advice and the principal’s decision. Even if the principal chooses to proceed, the team should still implement all reasonable measures to reduce the remaining risk.
