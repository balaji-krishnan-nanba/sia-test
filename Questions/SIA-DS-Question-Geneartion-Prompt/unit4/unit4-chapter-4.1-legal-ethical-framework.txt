SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 4, CHAPTER 4.1
LEGAL AND ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 30 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 4.1 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification - Physical Intervention Unit.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

WHAT IS UNIT 4?
---------------
Unit 4 focuses on Physical Intervention Skills - the knowledge and 
understanding needed when physical intervention becomes necessary. While 
practical skills are assessed separately, this unit tests theoretical 
knowledge of when, why, and how physical intervention should be used.

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 4: Physical Intervention Skills
- 30 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 45 minutes duration
- 80% pass mark (24 correct answers required) - HIGHEST pass mark
- This chapter (4.1) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 4
- Also includes practical assessment (not covered by these questions)

KEY PRINCIPLE
-------------
Physical intervention is always a LAST RESORT. It must only be used when 
absolutely necessary, must be legally justified, and must use the minimum 
force required. The legal framework is critical - getting it wrong can 
result in criminal charges, civil claims, and loss of licence.

CHAPTER 4.1: LEGAL AND ETHICAL FRAMEWORK - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 30
- Easy (direct recall): 12 questions
- Medium (application): 12 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 6 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.1: WHEN PHYSICAL INTERVENTION IS APPROPRIATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physical Intervention as Last Resort:
- Only when all other options exhausted or impractical
- Communication has failed or is not possible
- Threat is immediate
- No reasonable alternative

Lawful Purposes for Physical Intervention:

1. SELF-DEFENCE:
- Protecting yourself from attack
- Proportionate to threat
- No obligation to retreat (but consider if safe option)
- Pre-emptive strike can be lawful if attack imminent

2. DEFENCE OF OTHERS:
- Protecting another person from attack
- Same principles as self-defence
- Intervening to stop assault
- Proportionate response

3. PREVENTION OF CRIME:
- Section 3 Criminal Law Act 1967
- Preventing an offence being committed
- Must be a crime (not just rule breach)
- Proportionate force

4. LAWFUL ARREST:
- Section 24A PACE 1984 (citizen's arrest)
- Indictable offences only
- Offence must have occurred
- Necessity condition met

5. EJECTION OF TRESPASSER:
- Removing person who has no right to be there
- After permission withdrawn
- Reasonable time to leave given
- Minimum force necessary

What is NOT Lawful:
- Punishment or revenge
- Teaching someone a lesson
- Retaliation after threat has passed
- Force when person is compliant
- Excessive force beyond what's needed
- Restraint for summary offences (generally)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.2: LEGAL FRAMEWORK - USE OF FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3 Criminal Law Act 1967:
"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the 
prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of 
offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large."

Common Law Self-Defence:
- Defence of self
- Defence of others
- Defence of property
- Exists alongside statutory powers

Section 76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008:
- Clarifies law on self-defence
- Reasonable force in circumstances as YOU believed them
- Allows for "heat of the moment" decisions
- Does not allow disproportionate force

Key Legal Tests:

HONESTLY HELD BELIEF:
- What did you believe the situation to be?
- Genuine belief, even if mistaken
- Judged on circumstances as they appeared to you
- Not with benefit of hindsight

REASONABLE FORCE:
- What would an ordinary person consider reasonable?
- In the circumstances as you believed them
- Proportionate to threat
- Not excessive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.3: PRINCIPLES OF REASONABLE FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Three Requirements:

1. NECESSARY:
- Force must be needed
- No reasonable alternative
- Situation requires physical response
- Immediate need

2. REASONABLE:
- What a reasonable person would consider appropriate
- Not judged with hindsight
- Based on circumstances at the time
- Honest assessment of situation

3. PROPORTIONATE:
- Level of force matches level of threat
- Minimum force to achieve lawful objective
- Not excessive
- Adjusted as situation changes

Factors in Determining Reasonableness:
- Size and strength comparison
- Number of people involved
- Apparent fitness/capability
- Presence of weapons
- Nature of threat
- Severity of harm threatened
- Whether person is vulnerable
- Available alternatives
- Time to make decision

Escalation and De-escalation:
- Force should be graduated
- Start with minimum level
- Increase only if necessary
- Reduce as soon as possible
- Constantly reassess

When Force Becomes UNLAWFUL:
- Threat has ended
- Person is compliant
- Person is restrained/subdued
- Using force as punishment
- Excessive for the situation
- Continued after no longer needed
- Pre-planned violence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.4: DUTY OF CARE DURING PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing Duty of Care:
- Owed to person you're restraining
- Doesn't end because they were aggressive
- Responsible for their welfare
- Must take reasonable steps

What Duty of Care Requires:
- Use minimum force necessary
- Don't cause unnecessary injury
- Monitor their condition
- Respond to signs of distress
- Get medical help if needed
- Release restraint when safe to do so

Vulnerable Persons - Enhanced Duty:
- Elderly
- Young
- Pregnant
- Disabled
- Intoxicated (alcohol or drugs)
- Mental health issues
- Medical conditions

These persons may be:
- More susceptible to harm
- Less able to indicate distress
- React unpredictably
- Require modified techniques

Medical Emergencies:
- If medical emergency occurs during restraint
- Release restraint immediately (if safe)
- Provide first aid
- Call ambulance
- Life takes priority over restraint

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.5: PRE-EMPTIVE FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal Position:
- Do NOT have to wait to be hit first
- Can act if attack is imminent
- Pre-emptive action can be lawful
- But must still be reasonable and proportionate

Requirements:
- Honest belief attack is imminent
- Force is necessary to prevent attack
- Force is proportionate to threatened attack
- No reasonable alternative

Signs of Imminent Attack (review):
- Target glance (looking at where to strike)
- Clenched fists
- Weight shifting
- Chin dropping
- Colour draining
- Thousand-yard stare
- Removing clothing/items

Important Distinction:
- PRE-EMPTIVE (lawful): Acting to prevent imminent attack
- PRE-MEDITATED (unlawful): Planning to use violence

Example:
Person draws back fist to punch you → you can strike first.
Person is rude to you → you cannot strike them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 4.1.6: CONSEQUENCES OF UNLAWFUL FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Assault / battery (if no/minor injury)
