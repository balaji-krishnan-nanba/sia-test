================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 30 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.5 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Door Supervisor
- 50 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 75 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (35 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.5) is one of 10 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Drug use and dealing are common issues at licensed venues. Door supervisors 
must be able to recognise signs of drug use, understand the law, and know 
how to handle drugs safely. They also play a role in protecting the venue's 
licence - knowingly permitting drug use can result in licence revocation.
