--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.2: THE 12 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PRINCIPLE 1:**
Use of a surveillance camera system must always be for a specified purpose 
which is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and necessary to meet an identified 
pressing need.

Key Points:
- Must have specific purpose
- Legitimate aim required
- Must be necessary
- Pressing need identified

**PRINCIPLE 2:**
The use of a surveillance camera system must take into account its effect 
on individuals and their privacy, with regular reviews to ensure its use 
remains justified.

Key Points:
- Consider privacy impact
- Regular reviews required
- Must remain justified
- Proportionality

**PRINCIPLE 3:**
There must be as much transparency in the use of a surveillance camera 
system as possible, including a published contact point for access to 
information and complaints.

Key Points:
- Transparency required
- Published contact details
- Information available
- Complaints process

**PRINCIPLE 4:**
There must be clear responsibility and accountability for all surveillance 
camera system activities including images and information collected, held 
and used.

Key Points:
- Clear responsibility
- Accountability required
- Covers all activities
- Images and information

**PRINCIPLE 5:**
Clear rules, policies and procedures must be in place before a surveillance 
camera system is used, and these must be communicated to all who need to 
comply with them.

Key Points:

- Written policies
- Communicated to staff
- Procedures documented

**PRINCIPLE 6:**
No more images and information should be stored than that which is strictly 
required for the stated purpose of a surveillance camera system, and such 
images and information should be deleted once their purposes have been 
discharged.

Key Points:
- Data minimisation
- Only store what's needed
- Delete when no longer required
- Stated purpose limits storage

**PRINCIPLE 7:**
Access to retained images and information should be restricted and there 
must be clearly defined rules on who can gain access and for what purpose 
such access is granted.

Key Points:
- Restricted access
- Defined rules

its purpose and work to meet and maintain those standards.

Key Points:
- Approved standards
- Operational standards
- Technical standards
- Competency standards

**PRINCIPLE 9:**

appropriate security measures to safeguard against unauthorised access 
and use.

**PRINCIPLE 10:**
There should be effective review and audit mechanisms to ensure legal 
requirements, policies and standards are complied with in practice, and 
regular reports should be published.

- Audit processes
- Compliance checking
- Regular reports

**PRINCIPLE 11:**
When the use of a surveillance camera system is in pursuit of a legitimate 
aim, and there is a pressing need for its use, it should then be used in 
the most effective way to support public safety and law enforcement with 
the aim of processing images and information of evidential value.

Key Points:
- Effective use
- Support public safety
- Law enforcement support
- Evidential value

**PRINCIPLE 12:**

against a reference database for matching purposes should be accurate and 
kept up to date.

Key Points:
- Database accuracy
- Matching systems
- Keep up to date
- Accurate reference data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.3: DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018 / UK GDPR

The Data Protection Principles:

1. LAWFULNESS, FAIRNESS, TRANSPARENCY:
   - Lawful basis required
   - Fair processing
   - Transparent about use

2. PURPOSE LIMITATION:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.2.4: SUBJECT ACCESS REQUESTS (SARs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a SAR:
- Request from data subject
- To see their own data
- Includes CCTV footage
- Legal right under GDPR

Responding to SARs:

TIME LIMIT:
- One calendar month
- From receipt of request
- Can extend by 2 months if complex
- Must inform of extension

WHAT TO PROVIDE:
- Copy of footage (if retained)
