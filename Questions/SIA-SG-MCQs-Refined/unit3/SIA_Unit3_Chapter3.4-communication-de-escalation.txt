UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.4: COMMUNICATION TO DE-ESCALATE CONFLICT
Question 1 [Easy] – Verbal Communication

Which of the following responses best explains the reason for a security request in a calm, professional way?

A) “The reason I’m asking is that company policy requires us to check everyone’s pass at this entrance.”
B) “Just do what you’re told, please.”
C) “It’s policy, end of story.”
D) “Look, if you don’t like it, that’s your problem.”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Option A clearly explains the reason behind the request, uses respectful language and links it to company policy. This helps people understand why you are asking, which reduces frustration. The other options are dismissive or rude and are likely to escalate the situation.

Question 2 [Easy] – Non-verbal Communication

Which option best describes open body language when dealing with an upset person?

A) Standing very close with your hands on your hips
B) Relaxed posture, arms uncrossed and hands visible
C) Turning your back to the person with folded arms
D) Leaning forward and pointing your finger as you speak

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Open body language includes a relaxed posture, uncrossed arms and visible hands. This appears non-threatening and helps build trust. Hands on hips, turning away, or pointing can look aggressive or dismissive and may increase tension.

Question 3 [Easy] – Positioning and Stance

Which of the following best describes the interview stance used when speaking to a potentially aggressive person?

A) Standing directly in front of them, feet together, arms crossed
B) Sitting down with your legs stretched out and hands behind your head
C) Standing at about 45 degrees with one foot slightly back and your weight balanced
D) Standing side-on at 90 degrees, avoiding any eye contact

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The interview stance is a 45-degree angle with one foot slightly back and weight evenly distributed. This is less confrontational, gives better balance, maintains communication and still allows quick movement if needed.

Question 4 [Easy] – Active Listening

Which of the following is the best example of clarifying in active listening?

A) Nodding silently while the person talks
B) Saying, “I understand,” without letting them finish
C) Saying, “So you’re annoyed because you’ve been waiting,” then talking over them
D) Asking, “When you say the goods are ‘damaged’, what exactly do you mean?”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Clarifying involves asking questions to better understand what the person means. Option D asks for more detail and avoids assumptions. Nodding or cutting in does not clarify, and summarising without checking details can still lead to misunderstandings.

Question 5 [Easy] – Empathy and Rapport

What is empathy in the context of conflict management?

A) Understanding another person’s feelings and viewpoint, even if you don’t agree
B) Always agreeing with whatever the other person says
C) Ignoring emotions and focusing only on the rules
D) Being stricter so the person learns a lesson

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Empathy means understanding how someone feels and seeing the situation from their perspective. It does not mean you have to agree with them. You can understand their frustration while still following policy and maintaining boundaries.

Question 6 [Easy] – Defusing Techniques

Which statement uses positive phrasing to help defuse a situation?

A) “I can’t help you; it’s not my problem.”
B) “What I can do is ask my supervisor if there is another option for you.”
C) “If you don’t calm down, you’ll be removed.”
D) “That’s just the way it is, you’ll have to accept it.”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Positive phrasing focuses on what you can do rather than what you can’t. Option B offers a constructive next step, whereas the other options shut the person down or sound threatening, which can escalate conflict.

Question 7 [Easy] – Things That Escalate Conflict

Which phrase is most likely to escalate a conflict?

A) “I can see this is frustrating for you.”
B) “Let’s see what we can do to sort this out.”
C) “You always overreact like this.”
D) “Take a moment if you need to.”

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
“You always overreact like this” is accusatory and uses the word “always,” which is very likely to inflame emotions. The other options show understanding or move towards solutions, which usually help to reduce tension.

Question 8 [Easy] – When Communication Fails

Despite your attempts to calm someone down, their behaviour is becoming more aggressive and you believe violence is likely. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Continue arguing your point until they see reason
B) Move closer and raise your voice to show authority
C) Ignore the behaviour and hope it stops
D) Create distance, withdraw to a safer position and call for assistance

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
When communication is failing and violence seems likely, you should prioritise safety: create distance, move to a safer position and seek help (colleagues or police). Getting closer, arguing or ignoring the threat increases the risk.

Question 9 [Medium] – Verbal Communication

You are a security officer at a corporate office reception. A visitor becomes irritated when asked for photographic ID and says, “I’ve been here dozens of times, you know who I am!” Which response best uses clear, respectful language to explain your decision?

A) “I do recognise you, but the reason I’m asking for ID is that company policy requires us to check everyone, every time.”
B) “If you’ve been here so often, you should know the rules by now.”
C) “Look, calm down and don’t make this a big issue.”
D) “Because I said so. Do you want to come in or not?”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Option A explains the reason, refers to policy and remains polite and firm. B is sarcastic, C uses “calm down” which often escalates, and D is aggressive and unprofessional.

Question 10 [Medium] – Non-verbal Communication

You are dealing with an angry customer in a shopping centre who complains that you are “not listening”. Which change to your non-verbal behaviour is MOST likely to help build trust and reduce tension?

A) Folding your arms to show you are firm about the rules
B) Uncrossing your arms, relaxing your shoulders and making appropriate eye contact
C) Standing as close as possible so they know you are taking them seriously
D) Looking away regularly so you don’t appear to be staring

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Open posture and appropriate eye contact show attention and respect. Folding arms appears defensive, standing too close is threatening, and repeatedly looking away can seem like you are ignoring them.

Question 11 [Medium] – Positioning and Stance

In a warehouse corridor, a contractor is becoming agitated while arguing about access. What is the safest and most professional way to position yourself?

A) Stand directly in front of them, blocking their only way out
B) Stand behind them so they can’t see you moving
C) Stand at a 45-degree angle, keeping a safe distance and ensuring both of you have a clear exit route
D) Sit down on a low chair while they stand over you to show you are not a threat

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Option C uses the interview stance, maintains a reactionary gap and keeps escape routes available for both parties, reducing the feeling of being trapped. Blocking exits, standing behind someone, or letting them tower over you all create unnecessary risk.

Question 12 [Medium] – Active Listening

At a site gate, a delivery driver complains: “I’ve been waiting an hour and no one tells me anything!” Which response best demonstrates reflecting and checking your understanding?

A) “It’s busy today, you’ll just have to wait.”
B) “You’re not the only one who’s been waiting a long time.”
C) “I told you, you’ll be called when they’re ready for you.”
D) “So what you’re saying is you’re upset because you’ve been waiting an hour and no one has updated you, is that right?”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Option D paraphrases the driver’s concern and checks that you’ve understood correctly. This is reflecting and clarifying, key parts of active listening. The other responses dismiss the complaint or compare them to others, which increases frustration.

Question 13 [Medium] – Empathy and Rapport

An office worker is angry at reception about a delayed visitor pass and says, “This is ridiculous, you’re wasting my time!” Which opening statement best shows empathy while staying professional?

A) “I can see this delay has been really frustrating for you; let’s see what we can do to move things forward.”
B) “It’s not my fault; I’m only the security.”
C) “If you’d arrived earlier, you wouldn’t have this problem.”
D) “I don’t have time for this, there are other people waiting.”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Option A acknowledges the person’s feelings (“frustrating”) and moves towards a solution, helping build rapport. B is defensive, C blames the person, and D is dismissive and likely to escalate their anger.

Question 14 [Medium] – Defusing Techniques

A member of the public is upset because the usual car park entrance is closed. Which response best uses positive phrasing and focuses on solutions?

A) “I can’t open the car park for you, that’s just the rules.”
B) “What I can do is show you the nearest alternative car park and help you carry any heavy items.”
C) “If you keep arguing, you won’t be allowed back on site.”
D) “Calm down, it’s only a car park, don’t make a fuss.”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B says what you can do and offers practical help, which redirects the conversation towards solutions. A is negative and unhelpful, C is threatening, and D dismisses their feelings and uses “calm down,” which often inflames the situation.

Question 15 [Medium] – Things That Escalate Conflict

Which behaviour by a security officer is MOST likely to escalate a conflict?

A) Allowing the person time to speak without interrupting
B) Keeping hands visible and arms relaxed by your side
C) Rolling your eyes, sighing loudly and saying, “Here we go again.”
D) Using the person’s name and speaking slowly

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Eye-rolling, sighing and sarcastic comments are disrespectful and will almost certainly increase anger. The other behaviours are examples of good practice that help calm situations.

Question 16 [Medium] – Positioning and Stance

You are in a large retail store. Two customers are arguing loudly near an emergency exit and a friend of one customer is standing behind you watching. Where should you position yourself to maximise safety while trying to calm things down?

A) Stand directly between the two arguing customers with your back to the friend
B) Stand with your back against the closed emergency exit, blocking it so no one can leave
C) Stand very close to the more aggressive customer so you can control them if needed
D) Stand at a 45-degree angle, maintaining a reactionary gap, keeping all three people in view and leaving yourself a clear exit route

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Option D follows key positioning principles: interview stance, reactionary gap, not being surrounded, keeping everyone in view and maintaining escape routes. The other options either block exits, expose your back or place you too close.

Question 17 [Hard] – Active Listening

In an office lobby, an employee is very angry that their access card has stopped working and says security “never gets anything right”. Which approach best demonstrates full active listening?

A) Face them with open posture, let them speak without interruption, paraphrase (“So the main issue is your card suddenly stopped working and you feel we’re not helping, is that right?”), ask any clarifying questions, then summarise the next steps you will take
B) Let them speak, then immediately tell them what you think the problem is and what you’ll do
C) Keep typing at your desk while they talk, then say, “I heard you,” and ask for their name
D) Ask a series of quick yes/no questions to hurry the conversation along

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Active listening involves attending (giving full attention), reflecting (paraphrasing), clarifying and summarising. Option A includes all of these. B skips checking understanding, C shows poor attention, and D focuses on speed rather than understanding.

Question 18 [Hard] – Verbal Communication

You’re on night shift at an industrial site gatehouse. A driver is shouting because his delivery is late being unloaded and says you’ll “get him sacked”. Which verbal response best uses tactical empathy and professional language to de-escalate?

A) “If you carry on shouting, I’ll have to get you removed from site.”
B) “I can hear how worried you are about the delay and your job. Let me find out what the loading bay supervisor can do, and I’ll come back and explain the options.”
C) “Calm down, it’s not my fault your company can’t organise itself.”
D) “Look, everyone else is waiting as well, you’re nothing special.”

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B recognises and names the driver’s emotion (worried), shows understanding and then moves towards a practical solution, which is tactical empathy. A and C are threatening or insulting, and D belittles the person, all likely to escalate things.

Question 19 [Hard] – Non-verbal Communication

You are speaking with a visitor who seems more agitated whenever you make strong eye contact. You suspect that in their culture, intense eye contact feels disrespectful. How should you adjust your non-verbal communication?

A) Maintain strong eye contact and move closer to show you are in control
B) Look over their shoulder most of the time so they don’t feel stared at
C) Soften your gaze, use brief eye contact with natural breaks, keep an open posture and nod to show you’re listening
D) Fold your arms and look at the floor to show you are not a threat

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
Option C balances respect and attention: moderate eye contact with natural breaks, open posture and listening signals. A is too intense and threatening, B looks like you’re not paying attention, and D appears closed and uninterested.

Question 20 [Hard] – Empathy and Rapport

An employee who has worked at a site for many years forgets their ID card and becomes angry when you refuse them entry, saying, “So you don’t trust me now?” Which response best shows empathy without simply agreeing, while keeping professional boundaries?

A) “I know the rules are silly; I’ll let you in this time.”
B) “Rules are rules. If you forget your pass, you don’t get in. End of.”
C) “I agree it’s pointless to check ID, but management insist on it.”
D) “I understand it’s frustrating to be stopped, especially when you’ve worked here so long, but I still can’t let you in without your pass. Let’s see if reception can issue a temporary card.”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Option D acknowledges the person’s feelings, shows understanding, but maintains the rule and offers a solution. That is empathy without agreement. A and C undermine policy and security, while B is cold and likely to inflame the situation.
