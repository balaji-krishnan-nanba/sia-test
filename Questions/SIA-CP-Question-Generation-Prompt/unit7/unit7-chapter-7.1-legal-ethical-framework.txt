QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 21
- Easy (direct recall): 8 questions
- Medium (application): 9 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 7.1.1: LEGAL BASIS FOR USE OF FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources of Authority:

COMMON LAW (Self-Defence):
- Ancient legal right
- Defence of yourself
- Defence of another person
- Defence of property (limited)
- Pre-emptive action allowed

CRIMINAL LAW ACT 1967 SECTION 3:
- "A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances"
- In prevention of crime
- In effecting or assisting lawful arrest
- Statutory basis

CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND IMMIGRATION ACT 2008:
- Clarified "reasonable force"
- Householder provisions
- Honest belief standard confirmed

Key Legal Terms:

REASONABLE FORCE:
- What a reasonable person would do
- In the same circumstances
- With same information
- At that moment

HONEST BELIEF:
- What you genuinely believed
- Not with hindsight
- Can be mistaken
- Must be genuine

When Force is Lawful:

SELF-DEFENCE:
- Against attack on yourself
- Attack must be imminent or occurring
- Force necessary to stop it
- Force proportionate to threat

DEFENCE OF ANOTHER:
- Same principles as self-defence
- Protecting third party
- Including principal, colleagues, public
- Proportionate response

PREVENTION OF CRIME:
- Crime being committed
- Force to stop it
- Proportionate
- Reasonable belief

LAWFUL ARREST:
- Citizen's arrest powers
- Effecting arrest
- Preventing escape
- Reasonable force only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 7.1.2: PRINCIPLES OF LAWFUL FORCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Three Key Principles:

1. NECESSITY:
   - Force must be necessary
   - No other reasonable option
   - Cannot be avoided
   - At that moment in time

2. PROPORTIONALITY:
   - Force matches threat level
   - Not excessive
   - Reasonable in circumstances
   - Minimum to achieve aim

3. HONEST BELIEF:
   - Based on genuine perception
   - What you believed at the time
   - Not judged with hindsight
   - Mistaken belief can still be lawful

Necessity Explained:

WHAT IT MEANS:
- Force was the only option
- Other methods wouldn't work
- Immediate need for action
- Couldn't wait for alternatives

EXAMPLES OF NECESSITY:
- Attack in progress
- Cannot withdraw safely
- Verbal de-escalation failed
- Immediate danger

NOT NECESSARY IF:
- Could have walked away
- Could have called for help
- Verbal resolution possible
- No immediate threat

Proportionality Explained:

MATCHING FORCE TO THREAT:
- Unarmed threat = unarmed response
- Weapon threat = escalated response possible
- Size/number difference considered
- Severity of threat matters

FACTORS CONSIDERED:
- Nature of threat
- Severity of potential harm
- Number of attackers
- Weapons present
- Size and strength difference
- Vulnerability of defender

EXCESSIVE FORCE:
- More than needed
- Disproportionate to threat
- Continued after threat ended
- Unlawful

Honest Belief Explained:

THE STANDARD:
- Subjective test (your belief)
- But belief must be genuine
- Based on circumstances as you saw them
- Not what was actually happening

MISTAKEN BELIEF:
- Can still be lawful
- If honestly held
- Even if wrong
- Judged on what you believed

Pre-Emptive Action:

LEGAL POSITION:
- Don't have to wait to be hit
- If attack imminent
- Can strike first
- Based on honest belief

REQUIREMENTS:
- Genuine belief attack coming
- Immediate threat
- Still proportionate
- Still necessary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 7.1.3: CITIZEN'S ARREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal Basis:

POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 1984 S.24A:

CONDITIONS - ALL MUST BE MET:
1. Indictable offence committed (or being committed)
2. Reasonable grounds to believe person guilty
3. Impracticable for constable to make arrest
4. Arrest necessary (to prevent specific things)

INDICTABLE OFFENCE:
- Serious offences
- Includes "either way" offences
- NOT summary only offences
- Assault, theft, criminal damage, etc.

NECESSITY REASONS:
- Prevent physical injury
- Prevent loss/damage to property

Use of Force in Arrest:

PRINCIPLES:
- Same as other force
- Reasonable
- Proportionate
- Necessary

CONTINUING FORCE:
- Only while necessary
- To effect arrest
- To prevent escape
- Not for punishment

Risks of Citizen's Arrest:

LEGAL RISKS:
- False imprisonment
- Assault
- Unlawful arrest
- Civil liability

PRACTICAL RISKS:
- Escalation
- Injury
