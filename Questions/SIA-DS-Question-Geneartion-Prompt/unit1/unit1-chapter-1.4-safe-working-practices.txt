CHAPTER 1.4: SAFE WORKING PRACTICES - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 45
- Easy (direct recall): 18 questions
- Medium (application): 18 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 9 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.1: HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 (HASAWA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
- Primary health and safety legislation in UK
- Creates duties for employers AND employees
- Enforced by Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
- Criminal penalties for breaches

SECTION 2 - Employer's Duties to Employees:
"Every employer shall ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the 
health, safety and welfare at work of all their employees."

This includes:
- Safe plant and equipment
- Safe systems of work
- Safe handling, storage, transport of articles and substances
- Adequate information, instruction, training, supervision
- Safe workplace with safe access and egress
- Adequate welfare facilities

SECTION 3 - Employer's Duty to Non-Employees:
- Must not endanger persons not employed
- Includes customers, visitors, contractors, public
- Must conduct business in a way that doesn't put others at risk

SECTION 7 - Employee's Duties:
Every employee shall:
- Take reasonable care for their own health and safety
- Take reasonable care for others who may be affected by their acts/omissions
- Cooperate with employer on health and safety matters
- Not misuse anything provided for health and safety

SECTION 8 - General Duty:
- No person shall intentionally or recklessly interfere with or misuse 
  anything provided for health, safety or welfare

"Reasonably Practicable":
- Weighing cost/difficulty against level of risk
- Higher risk = more expected to be done
- Not absolute duty - what is reasonable in circumstances
- Cost includes time, money, effort
- Consider likelihood and severity of harm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.2: RISK ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal Requirement:
- Required by Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
- Must be "suitable and sufficient"
- Must be recorded (if 5+ employees)
- Must be reviewed regularly

Definition:
- Systematic examination of work activities
- Identifies what could cause harm
- Evaluates likelihood and severity
- Determines appropriate control measures

The 5 Steps of Risk Assessment:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE HAZARDS
- Walk around the workplace
- Think about what could cause harm
- Ask employees about problems
- Check manufacturer's instructions
- Review accident records

STEP 2: DECIDE WHO MIGHT BE HARMED AND HOW
- Employees
- Customers/visitors
- Contractors
- Vulnerable groups (young, elderly, disabled, pregnant)
- How might they be harmed?

STEP 3: EVALUATE RISKS AND DECIDE ON PRECAUTIONS
- Compare against legal standards
- Consider what is already in place
- Can hazard be eliminated?
- Can risk be reduced?
- Hierarchy of controls

STEP 4: RECORD FINDINGS AND IMPLEMENT
- Write down significant findings
- Identify who needs to take action
- Implement control measures
- Communicate to relevant people

STEP 5: REVIEW AND UPDATE
- Regular review (at least annually)
- After any incident or near-miss
- When work changes
- When new information available

Hazard vs Risk:
- HAZARD: Something with potential to cause harm
  Examples: wet floor, broken glass, aggressive person
- RISK: Likelihood that harm will occur AND severity of that harm
  Combines probability and consequence

Dynamic Risk Assessment:
- Ongoing, real-time assessment
- Used when situations change rapidly
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment
- Particularly relevant to security work
- "Reading the room" for threats

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.3: CONTROL MEASURES - HIERARCHY OF CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When controlling risks, follow this hierarchy (most effective first):

1. ELIMINATION:
- Remove the hazard completely
- Most effective control
- Example: remove trip hazard, ban glass containers

2. SUBSTITUTION:
- Replace with something less hazardous
- Example: use plastic glasses instead of glass

3. ENGINEERING CONTROLS:
- Physical measures to reduce risk
- Example: install barriers, improve lighting, CCTV

4. ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS:
- Policies and procedures
- Training and information
- Signage and warnings
- Changing how work is done
- Example: two-person patrols, regular check-ins

5. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE):
- Last resort, not first choice
- Protects the individual, not the hazard
- Example: high-vis vest, stab vest, gloves

PPE Requirements:
- Employer must provide suitable PPE free of charge
- PPE must fit properly and be suitable for the risk
- Employee must use PPE as instructed
- Employee must report defects
- Employer must maintain and replace PPE

Types of PPE for Security:
- High-visibility clothing
- Protective footwear
- Stab vests (in some roles)
- Gloves (for searches, first aid, handling)
- Communication equipment
- Torch/flashlight

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.4: SAFE SYSTEMS OF WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:
- Formal procedure for carrying out tasks safely
- Combines equipment, people, materials, environment
- Documented and communicated

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):
- Written instructions for routine tasks
- Step-by-step guidance
- Ensure consistency
- Reference document for training

Examples for Security:
- Patrol procedures
- Search procedures
- Incident response

- Competence = training + experience + knowledge
- Supervision until competent
- Refresher training as needed

Information and Instruction:
- Clear information about risks
- Instruction on safe working
- Warning signs and labels
- Emergency procedures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 1.4.5: LONE WORKING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition:
- Working without close or direct supervision
- Working in isolation from colleagues
- Common in security industry

Increased Risks:
- Violence and aggression
- Medical emergencies with no assistance
- Accidents with no one to help
- Delayed emergency response
- Mental health/stress

Employer's Duties:
