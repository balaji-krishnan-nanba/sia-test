YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 23 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 6.4 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5-6 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE UNIT
--------
Unit 6: Physical Intervention Skills for Close Protection
- Assessment: Practical assessment
- Chapters: 5
- Practice Questions: 111 total
- This chapter (6.4) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 6

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
While the primary CP response is evacuation, there are situations where
control and restraint of an attacker may be necessary - particularly when
evacuation isn't possible or when a threat must be neutralised before
evacuation can proceed. Safe, legal, and effective restraint techniques
are essential knowledge.

UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.4: CONTROL AND RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the HIGHEST risk position for positional asphyxia?

A) Recovery position (on side)
B) Seated position
C) Prone position (face down)
D) Supine position (face up)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The prone (face down) position carries the HIGHEST risk of 
positional asphyxia. In this position, body weight can compress the chest 
and restrict breathing. If restraint in prone position is necessary, it 
should be for the minimum possible time and the person should be moved 
to recovery position as soon as safely possible.

KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

RESTRAINT IN CP CONTEXT:
- Evacuation is PRIMARY response
- Restraint is SECONDARY
- Only when necessary
- Principal safety still focus

POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA:
- Prone (face down) = HIGHEST RISK
- Risk factors: intoxication, obesity, weight on chest
- Warning signs: gasping, turning blue, goes limp/silent
- Prevention: minimum time, no chest pressure, recovery position ASAP

GROUND POSITIONS:
- Prone = Maximum control but HIGHEST asphyxia risk
- Supine (face up) = Less control, better breathing
- Recovery position = Best for breathing, less control

POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA WARNING SIGNS:
- Cannot speak/only single words
- Goes limp after struggling
- Blue/purple colour (cyanosis)
- Gurgling sounds

DOUBLE LOCKING HANDCUFFS:
- Prevents further tightening
- Essential safety step
- Reduces injury risk

HANDCUFF TIGHTNESS:
- Snug but not tight
- Two-finger gap
- Check circulation
- Watch for numbness

RESTRAINT DURATION:
- MINIMUM time
- Not indefinite
- Transition when safe
- Hand to police

WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL:
- Breathing difficulties
- Loss of consciousness
- Excited delirium signs
- Any significant restraint

EXCITED DELIRIUM:
- Medical emergency
- Extreme agitation
- Superhuman strength
- High risk of death
- Ambulance immediately

POLICE HANDOVER INFO:
- What happened
- Force used
- Medical concerns
- Injuries

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- Supine is highest asphyxia risk (wrong - prone is highest)
- Restraint is primary CP response (wrong - evacuation is primary)
- Hold prone until police arrive (wrong - minimum time, recovery position)
- Single lock handcuffs is sufficient (wrong - must double lock)
- Release immediately when compliant (wrong - controlled release, create distance)

================================================================================
