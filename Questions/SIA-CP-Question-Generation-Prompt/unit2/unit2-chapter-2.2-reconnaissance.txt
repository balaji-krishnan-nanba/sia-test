BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Close Protection Operative
- 30 multiple choice questions
- 45 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (21 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.2) is one of 8 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Reconnaissance (recce) is the foundation of all CP operations. You cannot 
protect a principal at a venue you haven't seen or via a route you haven't 
checked. Thorough reconnaissance identifies risks, prepares responses, and 
enables smooth operations. "Time spent on recce is seldom wasted."

Question 1 [Easy]
What does the 'O' in OCOKA stand for when conducting ground appreciation?

A) Operations and Obstacles
B) Observation and fields of fire
C) Options and contingencies
D) Organisation and control

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: OCOKA is a military-derived framework for ground appreciation. 
The first 'O' stands for Observation and fields of fire - assessing what 
can be seen from where, lines of sight, and surveillance points. The full 
acronym is: Observation, Cover and concealment, Obstacles, Key terrain, 
Avenues of approach.

KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

TYPES OF RECCE:
- Map/desk recce (from office, research)
- Physical recce (on-site inspection)
- Covert recce (without revealing purpose)
- Overt recce (with coordination)

OCOKA:
- O = Observation and fields of fire
- C = Cover and concealment
- O = Obstacles
- K = Key terrain
- A = Avenues of approach

THREE ROUTE TYPES:
- Primary route (best option)
- Alternate route (backup)
- Emergency route (fastest to safety)

SAP TIMELINE:
- Advance notice (days/weeks before)
- Day before (physical recce)
- Day of event (arrive early, final checks)

VENUE RECCE MUST INCLUDE:
- External assessment (approaches, parking, entry/exit)
- Internal assessment (layout, rooms, emergencies)
- Security assessment (existing security, gaps)
- Principal's route through venue

ROUTE RECCE MUST INCLUDE:
- Timing (drive at planned time)
- Choke points
- Safe havens
- Emergency facilities

KEY PRINCIPLE:
"Time spent on reconnaissance is seldom wasted"

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- Physical recce replaces desk recce (wrong - desk first, then physical)
- OCOKA's K = Knowledge (wrong - Key terrain)
- SAP arrives with principal (wrong - arrives BEFORE)
- Primary route is fastest (wrong - best overall, not necessarily fastest)
- Recce reports are verbal only (wrong - written and structured)

================================================================================
CLOSE PROTECTION SCENARIOS FOR THIS CHAPTER
