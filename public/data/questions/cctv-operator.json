    "explanation": "Sequential patrols (camera 1, then 2, then 3, etc.) are easy to follow and ensure all cameras get some attention.

    "question": "A USB stick containing CCTV evidence is passed from Operator A to Supervisor B, then to Investigating Officer C. Operator A records handing it to B, and C records receiving it from B, but B forgot to sign the transfer section when giving it to C. The USB has remained sealed since leaving the control room. What is the best action now?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Destroy the USB and secretly re‑export the footage so the paperwork looks correct",
      "B": "Ask Officer C to sign B’s name and backdate the signature",
      "C": "Ignore the missing signature because the seal is intact",
      "D": "Record the omission in an additional statement or log, explaining the transfer, and inform the investigating officer/supervisor"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "You should never falsify or hide problems. The correct approach is to openly document the error, explain what actually happened, and inform the relevant people. Transparency helps the court assess any risk and may preserve the value of the evidence.",

    "question": "Someone who is under active police investigation sends a Subject Access Request asking for all CCTV of their arrest in a transport hub. The police ask the CCTV manager not to disclose the footage yet, as they believe it would prejudice their investigation. What should the organisation do?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Consider using the crime prevention/detection exemption, document the decision, and respond within one month explaining why the footage cannot be supplied now and how to complain",
      "B": "Ignore the Subject Access Request until the investigation ends",

      "D": "Refuse the request without giving any explanation"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Data protection law allows certain exemptions, including where disclosure would prejudice crime prevention or detection. The organisation may withhold or limit access, but must still respond to the SAR within the time limit, explain the exemption being relied on, and tell the individual about their right to complain or appeal.

    "question": "A control room has a 31‑day retention period. An operator witnesses a serious assault on day 1, makes no preservation action, and forgets to tell anyone. On day 35, the victim reports the assault, but the footage has already been overwritten. In future, which single action would be most effective in preventing this kind of loss?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Emailing colleagues about the incident but taking no action on the system",
      "B": "Immediately marking or exporting the relevant footage on the day of the incident in line with preservation procedures",
      "C": "Increasing the recording frame rate on all cameras",
      "D": "Calling the police but leaving the recording system to overwrite as normal"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Preservation must be prompt and proactive. As soon as a serious incident is seen, relevant footage should be protected from overwriting (e.g. by tagging or export), with documentation to match. Relying on memory or informal emails is not enough.",

    "question": "An operator exports footage of a theft onto an unencrypted USB stick to give to the police the next day. On the way home, they realise they have left the USB in a café. What is the most appropriate immediate response?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Wait to see if the café contacts them before saying anything",

    "explanation": "Losing an unencrypted USB containing identifiable CCTV footage is a potential personal data breach. The operator must report it at once so the organisation can assess the risk, try to contain the breach, and decide whether it needs to be reported to the ICO and/or affected individuals (sometimes within 72 hours).
