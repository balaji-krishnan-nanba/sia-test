- Acknowledge emotion while addressing behaviour

Avoid:
- "Calm down" (rarely works, often escalates)

- "You're overreacting"
- Dismissing their concerns
- Telling them how they should feel

Question 1 [Easy]
According to communication research, what percentage of communication is 
conveyed through body language?

A) Approximately 7%
B) Approximately 25%

D) Approximately 75%

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Research suggests approximately 55% of communication is conveyed 
through body language, 38% through tone of voice, and only 7% through the 
actual words used. This highlights why non-verbal communication is so
