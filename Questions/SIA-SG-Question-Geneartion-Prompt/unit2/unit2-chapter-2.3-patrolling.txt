BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer
- 60 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 90 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (42 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.3) is one of 7 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Patrolling is a core function of security officers. Effective patrolling 
deters crime, detects hazards, and demonstrates security presence. Security 
officers must understand patrol techniques, observation skills, and how to 
respond to findings during patrols. Poor patrolling can leave premises 
vulnerable and put people at risk.
