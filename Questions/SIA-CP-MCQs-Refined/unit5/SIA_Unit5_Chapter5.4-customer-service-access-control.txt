UNIT 5, CHAPTER 5.4: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
Question 1 [Easy] – Fire Safety

While working the main entrance of a venue, you notice smoke coming from a storeroom and can smell burning. What should be your FIRST action?

A) Go into the room to find the source of the fire
B) Raise the alarm using the venue’s fire alarm system
C) Look for a fire extinguisher and attempt to put it out
D) Phone the manager to ask what to do

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
The first priority on discovering signs of fire is to raise the alarm so that everyone in the premises is alerted and evacuation can begin. Only after the alarm is raised should anyone consider using extinguishers, and only if trained and it is safe to do so. This supports the duties under UK fire safety law, which focuses on protecting life through early warning and evacuation.

Question 2 [Easy] – Fire Safety & Evacuation

What is the MAIN purpose of a fire assembly point?

A) To provide shelter from the weather while people wait
B) To give staff a place to smoke during an evacuation
C) To safely gather people so they can be counted and kept away from danger
D) To store fire extinguishers and other equipment

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
An assembly point is a safe location away from the building where evacuated people gather. This allows staff to check who is present, identify anyone missing, and keep people away from the risk of fire or falling debris. They should not re-enter the building until the fire service says it is safe.

Question 3 [Easy] – Medical Emergencies

The recovery position is MOST appropriate for a casualty who is:

A) Unconscious but breathing normally
B) Conscious but complaining of chest pain
C) Not breathing and showing no signs of life
D) Having a seizure with uncontrolled movements

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
The recovery position is used for someone who is unconscious but breathing. It helps keep the airway open and allows fluids such as vomit to drain from the mouth, reducing the risk of choking. If a casualty is not breathing, CPR (if trained) and calling 999 are priorities, not the recovery position.

Question 4 [Easy] – Medical Emergencies (AED)

An AED (Automated External Defibrillator) should be used when:

A) The person is fully conscious but complaining of dizziness
B) The person is breathing normally but has a nosebleed
C) The person is complaining of chest pain but talking normally
D) The person is unresponsive and NOT breathing normally

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
An AED is designed for cases of cardiac arrest — when a person is unresponsive and not breathing normally. It analyses the heart rhythm and, if needed, advises and delivers a shock. Modern training for door supervisors and first aiders emphasises early use of an AED alongside CPR in such situations.

Question 5 [Easy] – Violent Incidents

A fight suddenly breaks out between two customers on the dance floor. What should be the door supervisor’s PRIMARY concern?

A) Protecting the venue’s reputation
B) The safety of themselves, staff and customers
C) Making sure the DJ doesn’t stop the music
D) Immediately detaining both people involved

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
In any violent incident, safety comes first: your safety, your colleagues’ safety and the safety of customers. Only once risk has been reduced should you think about detaining individuals or protecting property. UK guidance on door supervisor training emphasises assessing risk, using cover, and contacting emergency services as needed. 
GOV.UK

Question 6 [Easy] – Ejections and Removals

Before using any physical force to remove a customer from a private venue, what should a door supervisor do?

A) Clearly ask the person to leave and give them a chance to comply
B) Call the police immediately
C) Turn off the music and lights
D) Demand to see the person’s ID again

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
On private premises, door supervisors (on behalf of the licence holder/management) can ask a person to leave. Physical force should only be used if the person refuses to leave after a clear verbal request and warning. This helps ensure any later use of force is necessary, reasonable and proportionate, and is easy to justify in incident reports.

Question 7 [Easy] – Terrorism Response (Run–Hide–Tell)

During a suspected firearms or weapons attack near your venue, what does the “TELL” part of Run–Hide–Tell require you to do?

A) Tell the attacker to stop
B) Tell customers to run towards the police
C) Tell your manager you are going home
D) Contact the emergency services when it is safe, giving clear information

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Run–Hide–Tell is official UK guidance for firearms or weapons attacks. “Tell” means that, when it is safe, you should contact the police (999), give your exact location, describe the attackers, weapons, numbers and direction of travel, and update them as needed.

Question 8 [Easy] – Incident Documentation

Which of the following BEST describes a good incident report?

A) Written in slang with personal opinions and guesses
B) Written only from memory several days later
C) Only records what went wrong, not what actions were taken
D) Factual, chronological, complete and signed and dated

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Incident reports should be factual, accurate and written in time order. They should record what happened, who was involved, what actions were taken, times, locations and outcomes, and then be signed and dated. Opinions and guesses can weaken the value of the report in legal or disciplinary proceedings.

Question 9 [Medium] – Fire Safety & Disabled Persons

A wheelchair user is on the first floor when the fire alarm sounds. The lifts are not to be used in a fire. As a door supervisor, what is usually the MOST appropriate action?

A) Follow the person’s Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) and move them to the designated refuge point if stairs are not safe
B) Immediately carry the person down the stairs as fast as possible, even if alone
C) Leave them where they are and tell them the fire service will come for them
D) Ignore the PEEP and send them to the nearest toilet to wait

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Under UK fire safety law, the “responsible person” must plan how everyone, including disabled people, can leave the building safely in an emergency. This often includes Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) and refuges where people can wait in relative safety until assisted. Door supervisors must know and follow these plans rather than improvise unsafe methods.

Question 10 [Medium] – Medical Emergencies (Choking)

In the VIP area, a guest is clutching their throat, cannot speak, cough or breathe, and looks panicked. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?

A) Offer them a glass of water to help clear their throat
B) Ask them to sit down quietly and wait
C) Give back blows and, if ineffective and you are trained, abdominal thrusts
D) Lay them flat on their back in the recovery position

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
These are classic signs of severe choking. Encouraging coughing is useful if they can cough, but if they cannot breathe or speak, you must act quickly: deliver back blows and, if trained and still ineffective, abdominal thrusts, while calling for medical help. Laying a choking casualty flat can make things worse.

Question 11 [Medium] – Violent Incidents & Evidence

After a serious glassing incident, there is blood and broken glass on the floor. The victim has been treated and removed by ambulance. What should door supervisors do NEXT to best support any police investigation?

A) Mop up all the blood to make the area look better
B) Move furniture back to its original position
C) Allow customers to dance through the area as normal
D) Secure the area to preserve evidence and restrict access until police have assessed it

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
After a serious crime, preserving the scene is vital. Blood, broken glass and disturbed furniture can all be important evidence. The area should be secured and access restricted where possible, while ensuring safety and ongoing business needs are balanced. Good practice for security officers includes preserving scenes and supporting police investigations.

Question 12 [Medium] – Ejections & Duty of Care

A heavily intoxicated customer has been ejected for aggressive behaviour. Outside, they are unsteady on their feet and alone. What is the MOST appropriate action?

A) Leave them lying in a side road because they are no longer the venue’s problem
B) Encourage them to stay in a safe, well-lit area while you monitor them and try to arrange a taxi or contact a friend
C) Confiscate their ID until they sober up
D) Ignore them and go straight back inside to the door

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Door supervisors still have a duty of care after ejection, particularly where someone is vulnerable due to intoxication, age, disability or being alone. Ensuring a safe departure — such as arranging transport or contacting friends and monitoring them for a short period — reduces the risk of harm and protects both the person and the venue.

Question 13 [Medium] – Terrorism Response (Suspicious Items & HOT)

You find an unattended holdall placed behind a pillar in a quiet corner of the venue. No one claims it, and it seems out of place. Using the HOT protocol, what does HOT stand for?

A) Heard Once Today
B) Hide Or Tell
C) Hidden, Obviously suspicious, not Typical for the location
D) Heavy, Old and Torn

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
The HOT principle helps staff decide whether an item is suspicious: Has it been Hidden? Is it Obviously suspicious? Is it Typical for the location or not? If it is hidden, looks suspicious and is not typical, staff should treat it as suspicious, clear the area and contact the police rather than handle it.

Question 14 [Medium] – Communication & Calling 999

You call 999 to report a serious incident at your venue. What is the FIRST piece of information you should clearly give to the operator?

A) The exact location/address of the incident
B) The name of your duty manager
C) How many door supervisors are on shift
D) The type of music event taking place

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Emergency services need to know where to go before anything else. Giving the exact address and any useful location details (such as venue name and nearby landmarks) allows resources to be dispatched quickly while you provide further information about what is happening. UK door supervisor refresher syllabuses highlight location as a key first detail in emergency calls.

Question 15 [Medium] – Radio Communication

You need urgent assistance at the rear exit and are using your radio. Which of the following is the BEST way to communicate your message?

A) Shout loudly into the radio so everyone hears you
B) Talk rapidly for a long time so you can explain everything in detail at once
C) Use your radio right next to a suspicious package to save time
D) Identify yourself, state who you need, give a brief clear message and wait for a response

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:
Good radio procedure involves identifying yourself, giving a concise message, and then waiting for confirmation so the team understands and can act. Long, rushed or shouted messages can cause confusion. Also, around suspicious items, guidance warns against using radios close to the item in case radio signals could affect a device — another reason to move away first.

Question 16 [Medium] – Working with Emergency Services (Police)

A serious assault has occurred inside the venue and police have been called. When officers arrive, what is the MOST appropriate action for the lead door supervisor?

A) Immediately stand between officers and the suspect and argue your version of events
B) Meet the officers at the entrance, give a brief outline of the situation and guide them safely to the scene
C) Leave the building so you cannot be blamed for anything
D) Start interviewing witnesses in detail before police enter

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
Meeting and briefing the police helps them reach the scene quickly and safely. You should provide a concise summary (what happened, where, whether weapons are involved) and then follow their instructions. Door supervisors play an important role in guiding emergency services and preserving evidence.

Question 17 [Hard] – Fire Safety Scenario (Overcrowded Area)

The venue is busy and near capacity when smoke is seen coming from a cloakroom close to the MAIN entrance. The fire alarm is sounding and light smoke is spreading into the foyer. Some staff are starting to send everyone towards the main entrance past the cloakroom. As the senior door supervisor, what is the BEST instruction to give your team?

A) Direct everyone through the main entrance because that is the exit customers know best
B) Send one member of staff to tackle the fire while everyone else carries on as normal
C) Open and use alternative safe exits away from the fire, controlling the flow to prevent crushing and keeping people calm
D) Wait near the VIP’s table and only move when the fire service arrive

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
If an exit route is compromised by smoke or fire, it should not be used. Door supervisors must know alternative routes and manage the flow of people to avoid crushing and keep them away from the danger area. The priorities are safe evacuation, clear instructions, and preventing panic, not using the “usual” exit at all costs.

Question 18 [Hard] – Ejection & Medical Scenario

A customer was ejected 10 minutes ago for aggressive behaviour and heavy intoxication. On a later check, you find him collapsed on the pavement near a busy road. He is breathing but unresponsive, smells strongly of alcohol and it is raining heavily. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?

A) Drag him back into the venue and leave him lying on a sofa
B) Move him to a safer position away from the road, place him in the recovery position, call 999 and stay with him until help arrives
C) Assume he is just “sleeping it off” and leave him there after a quick look
D) Sit him upright against a wall and go back to the door

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
He is unconscious and vulnerable next to a road in bad weather. Duty of care continues after ejection, especially where there is clear risk. Moving him to a safer place, using the recovery position if breathing, calling 999 and monitoring him are all appropriate steps that protect his life and protect you and the venue if the incident is later investigated.

Question 19 [Hard] – Violent Incident with a Weapon

On the dance floor, you see a man swinging a broken bottle at another customer. You are about five metres away with only one colleague nearby, and there are many bystanders. What is the BEST immediate response?

A) Rush in alone and grab the attacker’s arm, regardless of the risk
B) Shout at customers to film the incident so there is evidence
C) Maintain distance, call for backup and police, use communication to move bystanders away and only physically intervene if it is safe and necessary
D) Lock all exits so the attacker cannot leave the venue

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
A broken bottle is a serious weapon. Your safety and that of others is the first priority. Creating distance, calling police, coordinating colleagues, and moving uninvolved people away reduces risk. Any physical intervention must be proportionate, necessary and as safe as possible, and you should avoid turning yourself into another victim. 
GOV.UK

Question 20 [Hard] – Incident Documentation Scenario

After a night involving a fire alarm, a violent assault and an evacuation where several people were injured, you are asked to write an incident report for your employer and the police. Which approach is BEST?

A) Write a detailed, factual, chronological account in the first person, including times, descriptions, actions taken and who you handed over to, and then sign and date it
B) Include rumours from customers about what they think happened to make the report more “complete”
C) Only record your own actions and leave out what other staff or emergency services did
D) Ask colleagues to sign a blank report so you can fill it in later if needed

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
Good practice (and many training syllabuses) stress that incidents and actions should be accurately recorded: who, what, when, where, why (if known) and how. Reports should be factual, chronological and detailed, with times and handovers noted, then signed and dated. This supports legal proceedings, complaints handling and learning from incidents.
