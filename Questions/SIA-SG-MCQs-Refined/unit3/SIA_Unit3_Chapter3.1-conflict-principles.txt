UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.1: PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Question 1 [Easy] – ASK Model (Recall)

What does the “A” stand for in the ASK model of conflict management?

A) Attitude
B) Aggression
C) Authority
D) Arrest

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In the ASK model, A = Attitude, S = Skills, K = Knowledge. A professional, calm and respectful attitude sets the tone for the interaction and strongly influences whether conflict escalates or de-escalates.

Question 2 [Easy] – What is Conflict? (Recall)

In the context of a security officer’s work, which statement best describes conflict?

A) Any situation involving physical violence
B) A disagreement or opposition between people that can range from minor dispute to serious violence
C) Any time a customer makes a complaint
D) A breakdown in company procedures

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Conflict is a disagreement or opposition between people. It can be purely verbal, passive, or become physical. It is not limited to violence or complaints, but is any clash of views, needs, or behaviour.

Question 3 [Easy] – Types of Conflict (Application)

At a corporate reception, a visitor stands in front of a staff-only door, refuses to speak and simply blocks the way, ignoring polite requests to move. What type of conflict does this behaviour show?

A) Verbal conflict
B) Physical conflict
C) Passive conflict
D) Territorial conflict

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The visitor is using non‑cooperation and deliberate obstruction without speaking. This matches passive conflict, where someone refuses to comply or assist rather than arguing or becoming physical.

Question 4 [Easy] – Causes of Conflict (Recall)

Which of these is an example of an environmental factor that may contribute to conflict?

A) Feeling disrespected by staff
B) Personal financial worries
C) Peer pressure from friends
D) Heat, poor ventilation and overcrowding in a waiting area

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Environmental factors include things like overcrowding, heat, long queues and uncomfortable conditions. Personal worries, disrespect and peer pressure can also cause conflict, but they are not environmental factors.

Question 5 [Easy] – FFFP Responses (Recall)

Which list correctly shows the four common human responses to conflict, often remembered as FFFP?

A) Fight, Flight, Freeze, Posture
B) Fight, Flee, Fright, Panic
C) Fight, Frown, Freeze, Panic
D) Freeze, Flinch, Forget, Panic

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The four typical responses to conflict are Fight, Flight, Freeze and Posture. Recognising them in others and in yourself helps you understand behaviour under stress and choose safer responses.

Question 6 [Easy] – Escalation Model (Recall)

According to the conflict escalation model, at which stage is it usually easiest for a security officer to resolve an issue?

A) Escalation
B) Calm
C) Crisis
D) Recovery

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Calm stage (Stage 1) is when people are thinking rationally and open to communication. Early intervention at this point is much easier than waiting until emotions rise in the Escalation or Crisis stages.

Question 7 [Easy] – Warning Signs (Recall)

Which of the following is a non‑verbal warning sign that a person may be about to become aggressive?

A) Swearing at staff
B) Refusing to answer questions
C) Clenching their fists and staring at the officer
D) Complaining about the length of the queue

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Clenched fists and a fixed stare are clear non‑verbal warning signs of potential aggression. Swearing and complaining are verbal signs; refusal to answer is more behavioural than non‑verbal body language.

Question 8 [Easy] – Positive vs Negative Approaches (Recall)

Which response from a security officer is most likely to escalate a conflict?

A) Keeping a calm, controlled voice
B) Listening and acknowledging the person’s feelings
C) Offering realistic alternatives within the rules
D) Using sarcasm when responding to the person

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Sarcasm is a form of provocative language that often increases anger and makes people feel disrespected. Calm tone, listening and problem‑solving are positive approaches that help de‑escalate situations.

Question 9 [Easy] – Role of the Security Officer (Recall)

Which of the following best describes a primary role of a security officer when conflict arises?

A) De‑escalate the situation and protect people and property
B) Win the argument to show authority
C) Physically remove anyone who disagrees
D) Decide and change company policy during the incident

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The security officer’s role is to prevent and de‑escalate conflict, protect people and property, and resolve issues professionally. They are not there to “win” arguments or change company policy on the spot.

Question 10 [Medium] – Causes of Conflict (Scenario)

In a retail store, a customer is refused an age‑restricted product because they cannot provide ID. The cashier explains the law politely, but the customer becomes loud and angry, insisting “You’re ruining my day!” What is the most likely main cause of this conflict?

A) Territorial issues
B) Frustration at being refused something
C) Group dynamics
D) Environmental factors

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The customer is upset because they are being refused something they want, a classic sign of frustration. There is no clear evidence of territorial issues, peer pressure or environmental problems in this scenario.

Question 11 [Medium] – FFFP (Scenario)

In a corporate office, a contractor is suddenly shouted at by their supervisor in front of others. The contractor goes quiet, looks down and seems unable to answer simple questions. Which response to conflict are they most likely showing?

A) Fight
B) Flight
C) Freeze
D) Posture

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Becoming very quiet, “mind going blank” and being unable to respond are signs of Freeze. The person is not running away (Flight), not being aggressive (Fight), and not trying to look bigger or louder (Posture).

Question 12 [Medium] – Escalation Stage (Scenario)

On an industrial site, a delivery driver complains about waiting too long. Their voice gets louder, they pace back and forth and their body language becomes tense, but no threats or physical actions have occurred yet. Which stage of the conflict escalation model best describes their behaviour?

A) Calm
B) Trigger
C) Crisis
D) Escalation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The Escalation stage (Stage 3) involves raised emotions, raised voice and changed body language, with rational thinking starting to decrease. A Trigger has already happened; this is not yet the peak Crisis stage.

Question 13 [Medium] – ASK Model (Application)

A new security officer at an office building knows the site procedures and legal powers very well, and has completed all training. However, they are often impatient, roll their eyes at customers and speak in a dismissive tone. Which part of the ASK model is their main weakness?

A) Attitude
B) Skills
C) Knowledge
D) None – they are balanced

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Their Attitude is unprofessional and disrespectful. Even with good Skills and Knowledge, a poor attitude can quickly create or escalate conflict, and it damages the reputation of the business.

Question 14 [Medium] – Environmental Causes (Scenario)

In a shopping centre, the air conditioning has failed on a hot day. There are long queues, people are sweating and several customers start arguing. Which factor is most likely contributing to the increased risk of conflict?

A) Personal issues at home
B) Environmental factors such as heat and overcrowding
C) Group dynamics and showing off
D) Territorial issues about space ownership

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Heat, poor ventilation, long queues and overcrowding are environmental factors that make people uncomfortable and irritable, increasing the chances of conflict. The scenario doesn’t mention specific personal, territorial or group issues.

Question 15 [Medium] – Warning Signs (Scenario)

At a reception desk, an unhappy visitor gives short, abrupt answers, steps closer than normal, repeatedly looks around the area and briefly glances at the officer’s chin and throat. Which behaviour is the clearest warning sign that they may be preparing for physical aggression?

A) Raised voice and complaining about delay
B) Short, abrupt answers
C) Target glances at the officer’s chin or throat
D) Refusing to sit down when asked

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A target glance at areas like the chin or throat is a behavioural warning sign that the person may be planning where to strike. The other behaviours show irritation and non‑compliance, but target glances are a strong pre‑assault indicator.

Question 16 [Medium] – Positive Language (Scenario)

A contractor is upset about being refused access to a restricted area on a corporate site. Which response from the security officer is most likely to help de‑escalate the situation?

A) “Calm down or I’ll have you removed.”
B) “There’s nothing I can do. That’s just the way it is.”
C) “If you don’t like it, complain to someone else.”
D) “I can hear you’re frustrated. Let’s see what I can do for you within the rules.”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Option D uses empathy, acknowledges feelings and focuses on finding a solution within the rules. The other responses are threatening, dismissive or provocative and are likely to escalate conflict.

Question 17 [Medium] – When to Withdraw (Scenario)

A lone security officer on a warehouse site challenges three trespassers. They begin to surround the officer, one clenches his fists and another looks around the yard. The officer feels increasingly unsafe. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Withdraw to a safe position and call for backup
B) Continue arguing to show who is in charge
C) Attempt to physically remove the apparent leader
D) Ignore the behaviour and continue as normal

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When personal safety is at risk or a situation is beyond one officer’s capability, it is appropriate to withdraw and call for assistance. Continuing to argue or attempting physical intervention alone could quickly lead to a dangerous crisis.

Question 18 [Medium] – Feeling Disrespected (Scenario)

In a corporate lobby, a visitor believes they were ignored while others were served first. They say, “You’re disrespecting me in front of everyone!” and become increasingly angry. Which underlying cause of conflict is most likely in this situation?

A) Misunderstanding of the building’s rules
B) Feeling disrespected and loss of face
C) Environmental noise
D) Territorial issues

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The visitor clearly feels disrespected and embarrassed in public, which links directly to loss of face. That sense of disrespect is a common cause of conflict, especially when it happens in front of other people.

Question 19 [Hard] – Escalation & Stress Responses (Scenario)

In a retail store, a customer has been shouting and pointing at a security officer. When another staff member approaches, the customer suddenly goes quiet, stares at the officer, breathes heavily and clenches their fists. The officer notices their own heart racing and a “tunnel vision” effect. Which statement best describes what is happening and how the officer should respond?

A) The customer has returned to the Calm stage, so the officer can relax and turn away
B) Both people are showing Flight responses, so the officer should stand still and wait
C) The situation is approaching Crisis, with clear stress and warning signs, so the officer should prioritise safety, create space and consider calling for help
D) The customer’s silence proves they have accepted the decision, so the officer should close the conversation quickly

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The customer’s clenched fists, fixed stare and heavy breathing are warning signs that conflict is moving towards Crisis. The officer’s own stress responses (adrenaline, tunnel vision) also show rising risk. At this point, the officer should prioritise safety, increase distance and seek assistance.

Question 20 [Hard] – ASK Weakness (Scenario)

A security officer remains calm and polite during a conflict at a corporate site and uses clear language. However, when a visitor questions their decision, the officer gives incorrect information about their legal powers and contradicts company policy, which later leads to a complaint. Which part of the ASK model most clearly needs improvement?

A) Attitude, because they were too relaxed
B) Skills, because they spoke too clearly
C) None – they handled the situation perfectly
D) Knowledge, because they misunderstood their powers and company procedures

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The officer’s Attitude and communication Skills were positive, but their Knowledge of legal powers and company policy was weak. ASK requires all three elements; poor Knowledge can create conflict, complaints and legal risk.

Question 21 [Hard] – Early Intervention & Negative Approach (Scenario)

In an office building, a visitor shows early signs of frustration at reception (sighing, short answers, folded arms). The security officer ignores this and only gets involved when the visitor is shouting. The officer then steps very close and says loudly, “You need to calm down now!” How has the officer mainly mishandled this situation?

A) They missed the chance to intervene early and then used a provocative approach that pushed the situation further towards Crisis
B) They followed the escalation model correctly by waiting until Crisis before intervening
C) They should have gone straight to physical intervention at the Trigger stage
D) The only problem is that they did not raise their voice enough

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The officer ignored early warning signs at the Trigger stage, losing the best opportunity to de‑escalate. Later they used provocative language (“calm down”) and invaded personal space, both negative approaches that can push a situation towards Crisis.

Question 22 [Hard] – Post‑Crisis Learning (Scenario)

After a conflict with a customer in a warehouse, no one is injured, but the customer leaves angry. The next day, the supervisor arranges a short debrief with the security officer. Which focus would best use the Post‑Crisis stage to improve future performance?

A) Proving that the customer was entirely at fault
B) Calmly reviewing what triggered the situation, the warning signs, and which responses worked or did not, then adjusting practice
C) Rehearsing arguments so the officer can “win” if the customer returns
D) Avoiding discussion of the incident so everyone can forget about it

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Post‑Crisis stage is an opportunity to reflect and learn. Reviewing triggers, warning signs and responses helps improve future conflict management. Blame, argument rehearsal or avoidance do not support learning or better practice.
