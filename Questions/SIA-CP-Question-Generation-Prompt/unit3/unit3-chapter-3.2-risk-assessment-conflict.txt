SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.2
RISK ASSESSMENT IN CONFLICT
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 22 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 3.2 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5-6 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 3: Conflict Management for Close Protection
- 20 multiple choice questions
- 30 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (14 correct answers required)
- This chapter (3.2) is one of 4 chapters in Unit 3

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
When conflict occurs, CPOs must rapidly assess the situation, evaluate 
threats, and make split-second decisions. Dynamic risk assessment enables 
CPOs to choose the right response - from withdrawal to physical intervention 
- while always prioritising principal safety.

UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.2: RISK ASSESSMENT IN CONFLICT
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is DYNAMIC risk assessment?

A) A written document completed before an operation
B) Real-time evaluation during a changing situation
C) An annual review of security procedures
D) A post-incident analysis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Dynamic risk assessment is the real-time evaluation of a 
situation as it unfolds and changes. Unlike static (pre-planned) risk 
assessment, dynamic assessment occurs in the moment, enabling CPOs to 
make immediate decisions based on current circumstances. It's a continuous 
process throughout any conflict situation.

================================================================================
KEY POINTS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS:
1. Assess (what's happening?)
2. Consider (impact factors, risks)
3. Decide (best course of action)
4. Act (implement decision)
5. Review (is it working? adjust)

OODA LOOP:
- Observe
- Orient
- Decide
- Act

THREAT LEVELS:
- High threat = ACTION REQUIRED NOW
- Medium threat = PREPARE TO ACT
- Low threat = MONITOR AND MANAGE

RESPONSE CONTINUUM:
1. Presence (deterrent)
2. Verbal (communication)
3. Positioning (distance, barriers)
4. Withdrawal (remove principal)
5. Physical control (restraint)
6. Defensive tactics (strikes)

COVER vs CONCEALMENT:
- Cover = stops bullets/attacks (physical protection)
- Concealment = hides from view (visual protection)

PROPORTIONALITY:
- Response must match threat
- Based on honest belief at time
- Not judged with hindsight
- Must be legally justified

PRINCIPAL SAFETY ALWAYS FIRST:
- Every decision considers principal
- Evacuation often best option
- Never compromise principal safety

TEAM ROLES IN CONFLICT:
- One engages threat
- Others protect principal
- Evacuation preparation

COMMON DISTRACTORS:
- Dynamic assessment is pre-planned (wrong - that's static)
- Cover means hiding (wrong - that's concealment)
- Always engage threats (wrong - withdrawal often best)
- Force judged by outcome (wrong - judged by circumstances at time)
- All team focus on threat (wrong - some must protect principal)

================================================================================
CLOSE PROTECTION SCENARIOS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

Use these scenario types in questions:

- "During dynamic risk assessment, the CPO's first step is to..."
- "A threat is approaching with a knife. The first priority is..."
- "What is the difference between cover and concealment?"
- "Using the OODA loop, 'Orient' means..."
- "A proportionate response requires..."
- "When the team encounters a threat, one member should..."
- "The response continuum places withdrawal..."
