B) Police can arrest on reasonable suspicion
C) Citizens can arrest on reasonable suspicion
D) Citizens have wider arrest powers than police

A) Theft
B) Drunk and disorderly
C) Common assault
D) Littering

Answer: A

A) Reading the person the full police caution
B) Telling the person they are under arrest
C) Searching the person for evidence

A) An offence that is always minor
B) An offence that can only be tried in the Crown Court
C) An offence that can be tried either in the Magistrates' Court or the Crown Court

A) Being drunk in a public place
B) Minor criminal damage under £5,000
C) Supply of controlled drugs

---
Question: Which of the following should a door supervisor NOT do after making a citizen's arrest?

A) Monitor the person's breathing and welfare
B) Conduct a full search for evidence
C) Call the police immediately

---
Question: What is the main risk associated with keeping a restrained person face down for a prolonged period?

A) Heat exhaustion
B) Dehydration
C) Positional asphyxia
D) Food poisoning

---
Q16 | Difficulty: Easy
---
Question: Before deciding to make a citizen's arrest, what should a door supervisor consider first?

A) Whether the person will be angry
B) Whether it is an indictable offence and the arrest is necessary
C) Whether the police station is nearby
D) Whether the person is known to staff

Answer: B
Explanation: A key part of the decision is confirming that an indictable offence has definitely occurred and that the arrest is necessary, rather than using other, safer options.

---
Q17 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A customer punches another customer, causing a bloody nose and visible bruising. Which category does this offence most likely fall into?

A) Common assault (summary)
B) Actual bodily harm (ABH) – indictable
C) Grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent – indictable
D) Public order offence only

Answer: B
Explanation: Where there is more than trivial injury (such as bruising and a bloody nose), the offence is likely to be ABH, an either-way offence treated as indictable for arrest purposes.

---
Q18 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor witnesses a man smashing several expensive bottles behind the bar, causing over £5,000 worth of damage. Which statement is most accurate regarding citizen's arrest?

A) No arrest power because it is criminal damage
B) Arrest power exists because it is summary-only
C) Arrest power exists because it is indictable criminal damage
D) Arrest power only exists if the man is drunk

Answer: C
Explanation: Criminal damage over £5,000 is an either-way offence and therefore indictable. Provided the other conditions are met, a citizen's arrest power exists.

---
Q19 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A woman is drunk and shouting abuse at staff in the doorway. She has not assaulted anyone or caused damage. What is usually the most appropriate response for the door supervisor?

A) Perform a citizen's arrest for being drunk and disorderly
B) Strike her to calm her down
C) Ask her to leave and, if necessary, eject her from the premises
D) Lock her in a back room until she sobers up

Answer: C
Explanation: Drunk and disorderly is a summary offence with no citizen's arrest power. The appropriate option is usually to ask the person to leave and, if necessary, eject them using reasonable force, rather than arresting.

---
Q20 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A shop security officer sees a man conceal a bottle of alcohol inside his coat and leave without paying. The officer stops him just outside, and the man still has the bottle. Which factor supports a lawful citizen's arrest for theft?

A) The offence is summary-only
B) The offence is indictable and has definitely occurred
C) The police station is far away
D) The man is arguing about the price

Answer: B
Explanation: Theft is an either-way indictable offence. The officer has directly seen the theft occur and the property is still on the suspect, satisfying the requirement that the offence has actually occurred and the person is actually guilty.

---
Q21 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor sees a fight start and believes one person is about to punch another in the face. The supervisor intervenes and uses a controlled push to separate them before any punch lands. Which principle justifies this action?

A) Force can only be used after the assault happens
B) Pre-emptive force can be reasonable if the threat is imminent
C) Force must always cause pain
D) Force is never allowed in a licensed premises

Answer: B
Explanation: Reasonable and proportionate pre-emptive force is permitted when the threat of violence is imminent. You do not have to wait to be hit before acting to prevent injury.

---
Q22 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Which of the following BEST shows that the "necessity" condition for a citizen's arrest is met?

A) The offence is minor, but the suspect is rude
B) The suspect is clearly guilty but calm and staying put
C) The suspect is likely to cause injury or escape before police arrive
D) The suspect has apologised for what they did

Answer: C
Explanation: A citizen's arrest must be necessary, for example to prevent injury, prevent damage, stop the suspect escaping or because it is impracticable for a constable to make the arrest.

---
Q23 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor arrests a man for serious assault and restrains him on the ground. The man stops struggling and lies still. What should the supervisor do regarding the level of force being used?

A) Maintain the same level of pressure to punish him
B) Increase pressure to prevent escape
C) Reduce or remove force, using only what is still necessary for safety
D) Keep him face down with maximum pressure until police arrive

Answer: C
Explanation: Force must always be proportionate and stop when the threat ends. Once the person is under control, force should be reduced to the minimum necessary, and the risk of positional asphyxia must be considered.

---
Q24 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A security guard believes an indictable offence has occurred but is not sure the person they are dealing with is the actual offender. What should they do?

A) Arrest the person anyway, just in case
B) Only arrest if they are sure this person is actually guilty
C) Threaten arrest to get a confession
D) Lock the doors and stop everyone leaving

Answer: B
Explanation: Under Section 24A, a citizen can only arrest where an indictable offence has actually occurred and the person arrested is actually guilty. Arresting the wrong person would be unlawful.

---
Q25 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor has arrested a suspect for burglary inside a venue. The police say they will be delayed. What is the most appropriate action?

A) Detain the suspect indefinitely until police arrive
B) Consider whether continued detention is still necessary and safe
C) Release the suspect immediately without recording anything
D) Move the suspect to a secret location

Answer: B
Explanation: The arrested person must be handed over "as soon as practicable". If there is a significant delay, the supervisor must continually assess whether continued detention is necessary, safe and justified.

---
Q26 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A customer is restrained on the ground and suddenly goes quiet, their lips appear blue and their breathing seems shallow. What should the security team do first?

A) Assume they are pretending and apply more pressure
B) Ignore it because the police are on the way
C) Immediately reposition them, check their airway and call emergency medical help
D) Take photos for evidence before doing anything else

Answer: C
Explanation: These are warning signs of a potential medical emergency, such as positional asphyxia. Preservation of life must come first: reposition, check breathing and call an ambulance immediately.

---
Q27 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Which of the following is the BEST example of a suitable alternative to making a citizen's arrest for a minor incident?

A) Detain the person for several hours to teach them a lesson
B) Eject the person from the premises and record the incident
C) Apply handcuffs and wait until the next day for police
D) Arrest the person for common assault

Answer: B
Explanation: For minor issues, ejection, recording the incident and possibly barring the person are often safer and more appropriate than making a citizen's arrest, especially where there is no power to arrest.

---
Q28 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: Which statement best describes the duty of care owed to a person who has been arrested by a door supervisor?

A) No duty of care because they are a suspect
B) Limited duty of care only to avoid injuries
C) A duty of care to monitor their welfare and obtain medical help if needed
D) Duty of care ends once they are handcuffed

Answer: C
Explanation: Once someone is in your custody, you have a duty of care to monitor their physical and mental welfare, keep them as safe as reasonably possible and obtain medical assistance when required.

---
Q29 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: After handing an arrested person to the police, what is the MOST important documentation task for the door supervisor?

A) Destroying any notes to protect themselves
B) Writing a full, accurate account of the incident as soon as possible
C) Posting about the incident on social media
D) Only recording the person's name

Answer: B
Explanation: A full written account completed as soon as practicable helps ensure accuracy and may be required later in court. It should cover what happened, why force was used and any witnesses or evidence.

---
Q30 | Difficulty: Medium
---
Question: A door supervisor uses force to eject a customer who is refusing to leave but has committed no indictable offence. Which legal basis justifies the use of reasonable force in this situation?

A) Section 24A PACE 1984
B) Section 3 Criminal Law Act 1967 (prevention of crime / trespass)
C) The customer's consent
D) The door supervisor's company policy alone

Answer: B
Explanation: Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 allows reasonable force in the prevention of crime, which includes dealing with trespass and protecting property, even when no citizen's arrest is made.

---
Q31 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You are a door supervisor at a nightclub. You see a man punch another customer several times, knocking him unconscious and leaving him with a deep cut and suspected broken nose. The attacker starts to walk quickly towards the exit. Which is the BEST option?

A) Do nothing and let him leave because police can find him later
B) Make a citizen's arrest using necessary, reasonable force and call police immediately
C) Block the door and threaten to beat him if he tries to leave
D) Lock all customers inside until police arrive

Answer: B
Explanation: The level of injury suggests at least ABH or possibly GBH, which are indictable offences. The offender is trying to leave, so arrest may be necessary to prevent escape and further harm. Any force used must be necessary, reasonable and proportionate.

---
Q32 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You suspect a man of stealing a phone from a table, but you did not actually see the theft and no one is certain who took it. The man is about to leave the premises. What is the MOST appropriate response?

A) Carry out a citizen's arrest based on suspicion
B) Ask him politely to stay and speak to police, but do not arrest
C) Grab him and search his pockets for the phone
D) Lock him in an office until he confesses

Answer: B
Explanation: Under Section 24A, citizens cannot arrest on reasonable suspicion alone; the offence must actually have occurred and the person must be actually guilty. Without certainty, arrest would be unlawful. You can request he remains and gather evidence for police.

---
Q33 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: During a fight, one man clearly attacked another, causing serious facial injuries. The attacker is now calm but trying to leave, while the victim agrees to wait for police. Which ONE of the following is the BEST approach?

A) Arrest and restrain both men on the floor
B) Allow both to leave because the venue is busy
C) Consider a citizen's arrest on the man trying to escape who clearly caused serious injury
D) Arrest the calm man and let the violent one go

Answer: C
Explanation: Where there is clear evidence that one man has committed an indictable assault and is likely to escape, a citizen's arrest may be necessary and lawful. The calm man who agrees to stay may not need arrest if he remains on scene for police.

---
Q34 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: You and another door supervisor have restrained a violent suspect on the ground after a serious assault. He is handcuffed, face down, and struggling. A crowd is gathering, and police are five minutes away. What is the MOST important priority now?

A) Maintain control while monitoring his breathing and reducing any risk of positional asphyxia
B) Ignore his complaints and focus on crowd control only
C) Apply more pressure to stop him talking
D) Take photos and videos for social media

Answer: A
Explanation: Once the suspect is under control, the priority is safety and welfare. You must continually check breathing, avoid prolonged face-down restraint and manage the crowd while minimising the risk of positional asphyxia.

---
Q35 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A security guard arrests a man for shoplifting after seeing him leave without paying. Later, CCTV shows the man had actually paid at a self-service till and the guard was mistaken. What is the most likely legal position?

A) The arrest was still lawful because the guard honestly believed a crime occurred
B) The arrest is unlawful because the offence had not actually occurred
C) The arrest is lawful because the police agreed with it
D) The arrest is lawful because the man looked suspicious

Answer: B
Explanation: Under Section 24A PACE, the offence must have actually occurred. While honest belief may provide defenses against criminal charges for wrongful arrest, the arrest itself remains technically unlawful if no offence occurred. This is why thorough assessment is crucial before arrest.

---
Q36 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A doorman arrests a suspect for serious assault and then keeps him handcuffed in a locked storeroom for over an hour, even though police could have attended sooner if called immediately. Which is the MOST accurate statement?

A) This could amount to false imprisonment and unlawful detention
B) This is acceptable as long as the suspect is guilty
C) This is required to teach the suspect a lesson
D) This is lawful if the suspect does not complain

Answer: A
Explanation: Detaining someone longer than necessary and failing to hand them to police as soon as practicable may amount to false imprisonment and unlawful arrest, leading to criminal and civil consequences.

---
Q37 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A door supervisor witnesses a man commit criminal damage over £5,000 in the car park by smashing several car windows. The man starts walking quickly towards a nearby train station. Police estimate they will be 20 minutes. Which option BEST satisfies the necessity test for a citizen's arrest?

A) Let him go because it is only property damage
B) Arrest him if necessary to prevent further damage and stop him escaping before police arrive
C) Follow him but do nothing else
D) Wait and hope the police arrive before he leaves

Answer: B
Explanation: Criminal damage over £5,000 is an indictable offence. Given the seriousness, risk of further damage and likelihood he will escape before police arrive, arrest may be necessary and lawful if carried out with reasonable force.

---
Q38 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A security officer has arrested a suspect for robbery. While waiting for the police, the suspect becomes very agitated, complains of chest pain and then collapses. What should the officer do?

A) Ignore it because the suspect might be pretending
B) Immediately call an ambulance and start first aid if trained
C) Continue questioning the suspect about the robbery
D) Tighten the restraints to stop them moving

Answer: B
Explanation: Preservation of life takes priority over the arrest. When someone becomes unwell, you must obtain medical help immediately and provide first aid if you are trained, while still keeping yourself safe.

---
Q39 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A door supervisor is considering arresting someone for a serious offence but realises the police are only two minutes away and can see the venue entrance from their parked car. The suspect is calm and not trying to leave. Which is the BEST course of action?

A) Make a citizen's arrest anyway to show authority
B) Wait for the police to attend and let them deal with it
C) Lock the suspect in a room until police arrive
D) Use force to restrain the suspect on the floor

Answer: B
Explanation: One of the necessity conditions is that it is impracticable for a constable to make the arrest. If police are close by and able to intervene, a citizen's arrest is usually not necessary and could be harder to justify.

---
Q40 | Difficulty: Hard
---
Question: A venue manager pressures a door supervisor to arrest a customer for being rude to staff, despite no crime having been committed. The supervisor refuses. Which statement best describes this decision?

A) Wrong, because staff must obey management instructions
B) Correct, because arrest without a crime would be unlawful
C) Wrong, because rudeness is an indictable offence
D) Correct, because the customer apologised

Answer: B
Explanation: A citizen's arrest requires that an indictable offence has actually been committed and the person arrested is actually guilty. Being rude alone is not a criminal offence and arresting for it would be unlawful, regardless of management pressure.
