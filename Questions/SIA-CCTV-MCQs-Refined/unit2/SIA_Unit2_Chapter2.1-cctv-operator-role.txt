UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.1: ROLE OF THE CCTV OPERATOR
Question 1 [Easy]
What is a PRIMARY purpose of public space CCTV systems?
A) To replace the need for police patrols entirely
B) To increase advertising opportunities for businesses
C) To monitor staff punctuality in nearby offices
D) To help prevent and detect crime in public areas
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Public space CCTV is mainly used to help prevent crime (through deterrence) and detect crime (by observing and recording incidents). It supports, rather than replaces, police patrols and is not installed for advertising or staff‑monitoring purposes.

Question 2 [Easy]
Which statement best describes public reassurance as a purpose of public space CCTV?
A) Ensuring all incidents are broadcast on local news
B) Helping people feel safer because they know public spaces are monitored
C) Allowing members of the public to watch CCTV monitors
D) Guaranteeing no crime will occur anywhere in the town
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Public reassurance means that people feel safer and more confident using public spaces because they know CCTV is being used to monitor and respond to incidents. CCTV cannot guarantee that crime will never occur.

Question 3 [Medium]
A shopkeeper complains that CCTV has “failed” because a theft still happened in front of a camera. Which response BEST explains a limitation of CCTV?
A) CCTV can deter and help detect crime, but it cannot prevent all offending or cover every area
B) CCTV prevents serious crime but not minor offences such as theft
C) CCTV always stops crime, so the cameras must have been switched off
D) CCTV only works indoors, so outdoor cameras never deter crime
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
CCTV is a valuable tool, but it has limitations. It can deter some offenders and provide evidence after an incident, yet it cannot stop all crime or see every angle. Crime can still occur even in monitored areas.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which of the following is a CORE function of a CCTV operator in a public space control room?
A) Patrolling the streets and physically breaking up fights
B) Actively monitoring camera images to identify incidents and risk
C) Issuing fixed penalty notices to offenders
D) Repairing faulty cameras and cabling
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The operator’s core role is to monitor cameras, detect incidents and communicate with partners. They do not patrol the streets, repair equipment, or issue penalties; those tasks belong to other roles.

Question 5 [Medium]
During a live incident, patrol officers are on their way to a reported fight in the town centre. What is the CCTV operator’s MOST important contribution while watching the cameras?
A) Zoom in as close as possible on one person, even if they lose the wider view
B) Wait until officers arrive, then write a report afterwards
C) Provide clear, real-time updates on suspects’ location, appearance and any weapons seen
D) Turn off nearby cameras to protect the privacy of bystanders
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
In a live incident, the operator’s key function is to support responders. Providing accurate, real‑time information about suspects, risks and movements helps officers reach the right place quickly and safely.

Question 6 [Medium]
An arrest has been made following an assault seen on CCTV. What is the MOST appropriate action for the operator regarding the footage?
A) Post a still image from the footage on social media to help identify witnesses
B) Secure the relevant footage and follow procedures to preserve evidence and maintain chain of custody
C) Delete all footage of the incident once the suspect has been taken into custody
D) Make a personal copy of the footage to watch later in case it is needed
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Evidence management is a key function. The operator must ensure relevant footage is identified, secured and handled according to procedure so that its integrity is maintained for any criminal or civil proceedings.

Question 7 [Easy]
Which of the following would you EXPECT to find in a properly designed CCTV control room?
A) Rows of open windows with the public looking in
B) Multiple monitors, CCTV control equipment and secure access
C) A shop till and public-facing counter
D) A loud public address system constantly playing music
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A control room is a secure environment with multiple monitors, control equipment and communication systems. Public access and distractions (like loud music) would undermine security and concentration.

Question 8 [Medium]
A CCTV operator reports regular neck and eye strain during their shift. Which action would MOST help address the control room working environment?
A) Turning all the monitors to maximum brightness
B) Turning off half the monitors to reduce the amount of work
C) Adjusting screen height and position, chair settings and lighting to reduce glare and improve posture
D) Opening blinds fully so direct sunlight shines on the screens
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Good ergonomics – correctly positioned screens, suitable seating and controlled lighting – help reduce strain and fatigue. Bright glare, poorly placed screens or simply turning equipment off do not address the underlying issue.

Question 9 [Easy]
Which skill is MOST closely linked to spotting small but important changes in behaviour or surroundings on camera?
A) Ability to drive emergency vehicles
B) Knowledge of building maintenance
C) Fast typing speed
D) Strong observation skills
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Observation is an essential skill for CCTV operators. Being able to notice small details and changes in behaviour helps with early detection of incidents and risks.

Question 10 [Easy]
Which personal quality BEST helps a CCTV operator avoid misusing camera systems for personal reasons?
A) Curiosity
B) Confidence
C) Sense of humour
D) Integrity
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Integrity means acting honestly and ethically, even when no one is watching. Operators with integrity follow procedures, respect privacy and do not use CCTV for personal or improper purposes.

Question 11 [Medium]
During a live search for a missing teenager, the police ask the CCTV operator for a description of a person seen on camera. What is the MOST appropriate way to respond?
A) Give a vague description such as “young person in casual clothes” to keep it brief
B) Wait until the teenager has left camera view and then send a written report
C) Use technical camera terms that demonstrate expertise with the system
D) Provide a clear, structured description including clothing, distinguishing features, exact location and direction of travel
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Effective communication means giving accurate, structured and useful information. Clear descriptions of appearance, location and movement help officers quickly identify the person they are looking for.

Question 12 [Easy]
In most public space CCTV schemes, which organisation is the PRIMARY operational partner when responding to crime in progress?
A) Environmental health team
B) Police
C) Ambulance service
D) Local business association
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
While CCTV control rooms work with many partners, the police are usually the main operational partner for crime in progress, as they have the powers to investigate, detain and arrest.

Question 13 [Medium]
Repeated late-night anti-social behaviour and licensing breaches are occurring outside a group of bars in the town centre. With which partner should the CCTV control room MOST likely work to tackle these issues strategically?
A) The local bus company
B) A national news channel
C) The coastguard
D) The local authority’s community safety / licensing team
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Local authorities – particularly community safety and licensing teams – are key partners for dealing with anti-social behaviour linked to licensed premises. They can coordinate enforcement and long-term solutions.

Question 14 [Hard]
On a busy Saturday evening, the CCTV operator sees a person collapse in a crowded pedestrian area. People gather around and the nearest road access is partly blocked by parked vehicles. What is the MOST appropriate immediate course of action?
A) Call the ambulance service, then guide them and the police to the scene using cameras, monitoring the crowd and access routes for hazards
B) Announce on social media that there is an emergency and ask the public to move vehicles
C) Use the cameras to zoom in closely on the casualty’s face and do nothing else until the picture is perfect
D) Wait to see if members of the public deal with the situation before contacting any partner agencies
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Supporting emergency services is a key purpose of CCTV. The operator should promptly alert the ambulance service (and police if required), then use cameras to direct them efficiently and monitor access and crowd safety.

Question 15 [Easy]
Which of the following is an example of reactive monitoring?
A) Planning which cameras to use for an upcoming football match
B) Watching school routes at home time to deter bullying
C) Focusing cameras on a street only after the police report a fight there
D) Routinely scanning known trouble spots before the pubs close
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Reactive monitoring means responding to something that has already been reported, such as a police call or alarm activation. Proactive monitoring involves searching for problems before they are reported.

Question 16 [Medium]
After dealing with several earlier incidents, the control room is quiet and no requests are coming in. What is the BEST example of proactive monitoring that still allows the operator to respond quickly to new incidents?
A) Rewinding recordings from earlier in the day for personal interest
B) Using the time to check personal emails on the control room computer
C) Turning all cameras towards quiet residential streets and leaving them there
D) Conducting a systematic camera patrol of known hotspots and vulnerable locations while listening out for any new calls
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Proactive monitoring means actively looking for issues, especially in known hotspots or vulnerable locations. The operator should continue to scan live images and remain ready to react to any new information.

Question 17 [Hard]
A lone CCTV operator is proactively monitoring a known trouble spot near a pub late on Friday night. A Shopwatch radio call reports a suspected shoplifter who has quietly left a nearby store. At the same time, the operator sees a large, noisy crowd forming outside the pub where serious assaults have happened before. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Prioritise monitoring the developing crowd near the pub, alerting police if needed, while briefly checking the shoplifter area when possible and recording details from the Shopwatch report
B) Ignore the crowd near the pub and focus only on the suspected shoplifter because the request came in by radio
C) Split the main monitor between replaying last night’s incidents and live cameras to show they are being proactive
D) Stop all monitoring and immediately start reviewing earlier footage in case something was missed
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Operators must balance reactive requests with proactive risk assessment. A large, potentially volatile crowd at a known trouble spot presents a higher immediate risk than a non‑violent suspected shoplifter who has already left. Monitoring the crowd and informing police while recording shoplifter details is a risk‑based, proportionate response.

Question 18 [Easy]
Which of the following actions is WITHIN the normal scope of a CCTV operator’s role?
A) Forcing entry into private premises to check what is happening
B) Directing police officers by radio to a suspect while monitoring them on camera
C) Issuing on‑the‑spot fines to offenders seen on CCTV
D) Stopping and searching a suspect in the street
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
CCTV operators do not have extra powers to stop, search or fine people. They support those who do, such as the police, by monitoring cameras and providing accurate information and guidance.

Question 19 [Medium]
While monitoring cameras, a CCTV operator sees two groups arguing aggressively, and one person is holding a bottle in a threatening way. No call has yet been received. What is the MOST appropriate action?
A) Treat it as a potential serious incident, inform the police or appropriate partner immediately, and continue monitoring to provide updates
B) Leave the control room to try to calm the situation in person
C) Do nothing until someone calls the control room or police
D) Send the footage to friends to see what they think before deciding
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The operator’s role is to observe and report, not physically intervene. This could escalate into violence, so it should be reported promptly to police or the appropriate partner, with ongoing updates from the cameras.

Question 20 [Hard]
During an incident, the operator sees a person holding a small dark object. The police radio in and ask, “Can you confirm it’s a knife?” The image is unclear. What should the operator do?
A) Say it is not a knife because there is no absolute proof
B) Confirm that it is definitely a knife so that officers treat it as high risk
C) Explain honestly that the object cannot be clearly identified, describe exactly what can be seen, and let officers assess the risk
D) Refuse to answer the question and switch cameras to avoid involvement
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Operators must stay within their limitations and be honest about what they can and cannot see. They should accurately describe the image without guessing, allowing officers to assess risk based on the best available information.

Question 21 [Medium]
You notice a colleague using their mobile phone to photograph images on the CCTV monitor of a celebrity in the town centre “for personal use”. What is the MOST appropriate response?
A) Ignore it, as no crime has taken place
B) Challenge or report the behaviour in line with procedures, as this is an inappropriate use of CCTV images
C) Post the image on your own social media to warn others the celebrity is in town
D) Ask them to send you a copy so you can both keep it
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Professionalism and confidentiality are vital. Capturing CCTV images on a personal device is misuse of the system and a potential data protection breach. It should be challenged and reported according to local policy.

Question 22 [Hard]
During a night shift, a close friend phones the control room and asks you to use the cameras to see whether their ex‑partner is in town and who they are with, saying, “It’s only for me, nobody else will know.” What is the MOST appropriate response?
A) Check briefly and give only a yes/no answer
B) Ask another operator to do it so you are not personally involved
C) Refuse the request, explain that this would be misuse of the system, and follow local procedures for reporting inappropriate requests if necessary
D) Agree, as long as you do not save any still images
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Using CCTV for personal reasons is unethical and may be illegal. Operators must refuse such requests, explain their professional obligations and, where required, record or report the attempt to misuse the system.
