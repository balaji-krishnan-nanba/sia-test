UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.5: FOOT FORMATIONS AND DRILLS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
In a BOX formation, what is the primary responsibility of the POINT (front) 
position?

A) Covering threats from behind
B) Clearing the path and identifying forward threats
C) Managing crowds on the left side
D) Carrying equipment for the team

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Point (front) position in a box formation is responsible 
for clearing the path ahead and identifying threats in the forward arc 
(180° forward). They lead the formation, set the pace, navigate, and make 
first contact with any obstacles or potential threats ahead of the principal.
