SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.6
INCIDENT RECORDING AND CRIME SCENE PRESERVATION
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 18 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.6 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Door Supervisor
- 50 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 75 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (35 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.6) is one of 10 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Good incident recording protects the door supervisor, the venue, and 
supports prosecution of offenders. Poor recording can result in 
failed prosecutions, successful civil claims, and professional criticism.
Crime scene preservation ensures evidence is available for police.
