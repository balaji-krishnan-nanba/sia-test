SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.3
ROUTE SELECTION AND SECURITY
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 22 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.3 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5-6 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Close Protection Operative
- 30 multiple choice questions
- 45 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (21 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.3) is one of 8 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
The principal is most vulnerable during transit. Route selection directly 
impacts security - the wrong route increases risk, the right route with 
proper planning reduces exposure. CPOs must understand how to select, plan, 
and secure routes for all movements.

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.3: ROUTE SELECTION AND SECURITY
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the PRIMARY purpose of an emergency route?

A) To provide the most scenic journey
B) To get the principal to safety as fast as possible
C) To avoid all traffic congestion
D) To reduce fuel consumption

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An emergency route is designed to get the principal to safety 
as fast as possible during an incident. It leads to a safe haven or medical 
facility and prioritises speed and safety over comfort or convenience. 
Emergency routes are used during attacks, medical emergencies, or when 
immediate evacuation is needed.
