SIA DOOR SUPERVISOR - UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.4
POWERS OF ARREST (DOOR SUPERVISOR CONTEXT)
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 25 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 2.4 of 
the SIA Door Supervisor Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Working as a Door Supervisor
- 50 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 75 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (35 correct answers required)
- This chapter (2.4) is one of 10 chapters in Unit 2

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
This chapter applies arrest law specifically to door supervisor situations.
While Unit 1 covers the general legal framework, this chapter focuses on 
practical application: when to arrest vs eject, common venue scenarios, 
and the risks involved. Most situations are better handled by ejection 
than arrest.

CHAPTER 2.4: POWERS OF ARREST - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 25
- Easy (direct recall): 10 questions
- Medium (application): 10 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 5 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.1: SECTION 24A PACE - REVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Legal Framework:
- Section 24A Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
- "Any person" arrest (citizen's arrest)
- Same powers as any member of public
- Door supervisors have NO special powers

Conditions for Lawful Arrest:

CONDITION 1 - OFFENCE REQUIREMENT:

For offence in progress:
- Person IS committing an indictable offence, OR
- Person IS guilty of offence just committed

For completed offence:
- Offence HAS ACTUALLY been committed, AND
- Person IS guilty of that offence

CONDITION 2 - NECESSITY REQUIREMENT:
- Prevent injury to self or others
- Prevent loss/damage to property
- Prevent person making off before police arrive
- Appears impracticable for police to make arrest

BOTH conditions must be met for lawful arrest.

Key Difference from Police:
- Police: can arrest on "reasonable suspicion"
- Citizens: offence must ACTUALLY have occurred
- If no crime happened = unlawful arrest
- If wrong person = unlawful arrest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.2: ARREST VS EJECTION - THE KEY DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EJECTION is Usually Preferred:
- Lower risk than arrest
- Achieves main goal (remove problem)
- Less physical confrontation
- Less legal risk
- Quicker resolution

When Ejection is Appropriate:
- Intoxication
- Breach of venue rules
- Minor altercations (no injury)
- Trespass after being asked to leave
- Offensive behaviour
- Most situations

When Arrest May Be Appropriate:
- Serious indictable offence committed
- Ongoing threat to safety
- Person will escape before police arrive
- Evidence will be lost
- Police cannot attend in time

Key Questions Before Arrest:
1. Is this an INDICTABLE offence?
2. Did the offence ACTUALLY occur?
3. Is this the RIGHT person?
4. Is arrest NECESSARY?
5. Are there safer alternatives?

Risk Assessment:
- Arrest creates confrontation
- Higher risk of injury (to all)
- Greater legal exposure
- More documentation required
- Potential for civil claim
- Potential for criminal charges if wrong

The Professional Approach:
- Eject unless arrest clearly necessary
- Call police and let them arrest
- Gather evidence for police
- Preserve scene and witnesses
- Your safety and others' safety first

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.3: COMMON SCENARIOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEFT:
- Theft is INDICTABLE (arrest power exists)
- But must be clear evidence
- Consider: value, evidence quality, cooperation
- Often better to detain and call police
- Risk: wrong person, no theft occurred

Scenario example:
Customer seen putting items in bag without paying.
- If clearly witnessed: arrest may be appropriate
- If unsure: detain, call police, let them decide
- If customer cooperative: call police, no physical restraint needed

ASSAULT/VIOLENCE:
- Common assault = SUMMARY = NO arrest power
- ABH/GBH = INDICTABLE = arrest possible
- Assess severity of injury
- Is there ongoing threat?
- Often threat has passed by time you respond

Scenario example:
Customer punches another customer once, then stops.
- If minor/no injury (common assault): eject, call police
- If significant injury (ABH+): arrest may be appropriate
- If threat has passed: eject and preserve evidence

DRUG DEALING:
- Supply of drugs = INDICTABLE = arrest possible
- Must be clear evidence of DEALING, not just possession
- Simple possession is summary (no arrest power)
- Contact police immediately
- Preserve evidence

Scenario example:
Customer seen exchanging wraps for money.
- Clear dealing: arrest may be appropriate
- Seize drugs, call police
- Often better to observe, call police, let them handle

CRIMINAL DAMAGE:
- OVER £5,000 = either way = arrest possible
- UNDER £5,000 = summary = NO arrest power
- Usually damage is under threshold
- Often better to eject and call police
- Document damage for police/insurance

SEXUAL OFFENCES:
- Indictable offences = arrest possible
- But highly sensitive situations
- Prioritise victim safety
- Preserve evidence
- Call police immediately
- Let police handle arrest where possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.4: PERFORMING THE ARREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps:
1. Tell them they are under arrest
2. Tell them the offence
3. Tell them why arrest is necessary
4. Use minimum force if resisted

You Do NOT:
- Caution them (police do this)
- Interview or question them
- Search for evidence (safety pat-down only)
- Punish or lecture them

Use of Force:
- Reasonable force to effect arrest
- Minimum necessary
- Must be proportionate
- Constantly reassess
- Stop when no longer needed

Communication:
- Stay calm
- Clear, simple instructions
- Don't argue or debate
- Don't rise to provocation
- Professional throughout

Witness:
- Have colleague witness if possible
- Identify independent witnesses
- Note their details for police

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.5: POST-ARREST PROCEDURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 2.4.6: RESTRAINT AND WELFARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minimum Restraint:
- Only what is necessary
- Release/reduce when compliant
- Check circulation if using holds

Positional Asphyxia:
- Risk when restrained, especially face down
- Weight on back restricts breathing
- Drugs/alcohol increase risk
- Signs: struggling to breathe, going quiet, colour change
- MUST reposition if concerned
- Can be fatal

Monitoring:
- Breathing
- Consciousness
- Colour
- Responses
- Any deterioration = get help immediately

Medical Attention:
- If any concern, call ambulance

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.4: POWERS OF ARREST (DOOR SUPERVISOR CONTEXT)
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
In most situations at a licensed venue, what is the preferred approach 
rather than making an arrest?

A) Physical restraint until police arrive
B) Ejection from the premises
C) Citizen's arrest for any offence
D) Verbal warning only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Ejection is usually preferred over arrest. It achieves the main 
objective (removing the problem), involves less physical confrontation, 
carries less legal risk, and is a quicker resolution. Arrest should only 
be considered for serious indictable offences where necessary.
