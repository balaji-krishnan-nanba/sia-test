UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.3: PROTECTIVE ESCORT AND EVACUATION TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
In a "Contact Front" drill, which direction should the principal be 
evacuated?

A) Forward, through the threat
B) To the left
C) To the rear
D) Principal stays in place

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In a "Contact Front" drill, the threat is from the front, 
so the principal should be evacuated to the REAR - away from the threat. 
The principle is always to move the principal in the opposite direction 
to the contact. Contact Front = Evacuate Rear; Contact Rear = Evacuate 
Forward; Contact Left = Evacuate Right; Contact Right = Evacuate Left.

================================================================================

MUST GET CORRECT:

CONTACT DRILLS:
- Contact FRONT → Evacuate REAR
- Contact REAR → Evacuate FORWARD
- Contact LEFT → Evacuate RIGHT

2. Alert (team and principal)
3. Move (fastest safe route)
4. Protect (cover throughout)
5. Secure (reach safe location)

VEHICLE AS COVER:
- Engine block = BEST cover (stops bullets)

- Tyres/wheels = Some protection

EMBUS PROCEDURE:
- CPO opens door
- Shields opening
- Principal enters quickly
- Door closed immediately

WEDGE FORMATION:
- V-shape for crowd penetration
- Point at front creates path
- Used for crowd evacuation

DEALING WITH PANICKED PRINCIPAL:
- Calm but firm voice

- If team separated
- Primary, Alternate, Emergency

TWO-PERSON TEAM DRILL:

- Vehicle doors provide cover (wrong - concealment only)
- Let panicked principal calm down (wrong - get them moving)
- Wedge formation is for small spaces (wrong - for crowds)
- Stay with principal, don't engage threat (wrong - team splits)

================================================================================
CLOSE PROTECTION SCENARIOS FOR THIS CHAPTER
================================================================================

Use these scenario types in questions:

- "Contact Front means the principal should be evacuated to..."
- "Which part of a vehicle provides the best cover?"
