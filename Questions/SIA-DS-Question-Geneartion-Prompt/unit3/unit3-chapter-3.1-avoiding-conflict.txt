BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

WHAT IS UNIT 3?
---------------
Unit 3 focuses on Conflict Management - the skills needed to avoid, defuse,

This is a critical skill for door supervisors as most situations can and 
should be resolved through communication and de-escalation.

THE EXAM

Unit 3: Conflict Management
- 20 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 30 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (14 correct answers required)

The best conflict is one that never happens. Avoiding conflict through 
early recognition, understanding triggers, and proactive intervention is 
always preferable to managing an escalated situation.
