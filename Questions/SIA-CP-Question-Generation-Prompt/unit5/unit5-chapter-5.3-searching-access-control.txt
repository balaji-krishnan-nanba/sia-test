UNIT 5, CHAPTER 5.3: SEARCHING AND ACCESS CONTROL
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the PRIMARY legal basis for a door supervisor to search a patron?

A) Police powers delegated to door supervisors
B) SIA licence grants search powers
C) CONSENT from the person being searched
D) Criminal Law Act 1967

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The primary legal basis for searching is CONSENT. Door 
supervisors have no special legal powers to search - they have the same 
powers as any citizen. Searching is permitted when the person consents, 
usually as a condition of entry to the venue. If a person refuses, they 
can be denied entry but cannot be forcibly searched.
