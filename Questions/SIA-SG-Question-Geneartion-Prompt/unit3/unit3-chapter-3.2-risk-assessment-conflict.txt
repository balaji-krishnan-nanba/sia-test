SIA SECURITY GUARD - UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.2
RECOGNISE, ASSESS AND REDUCE RISK IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 22 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 3.2 of 
the SIA Security Guard Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.

================================================================================
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE EXAM
--------
Unit 3: Application of Conflict Management in the Private Security Industry
- 20 multiple choice questions in actual exam
- 30 minutes duration
- 70% pass mark (14 correct answers required)
- This chapter (3.2) is one of 4 chapters in Unit 3

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Security officers must continuously assess situations for potential risk. 
Dynamic risk assessment allows security officers to recognise threats, 
evaluate the level of danger, and take appropriate action to reduce risk. 
This protects the security officer, members of the public, and helps 
ensure situations are managed safely and professionally.

CHAPTER 3.2: RISK ASSESSMENT IN CONFLICT - DETAILED SYLLABUS
================================================================================

QUESTIONS REQUIRED: 22
- Easy (direct recall): 9 questions
- Medium (application): 9 questions
- Hard (scenario-based): 4 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.2.1: DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Dynamic Risk Assessment?
- Continuous, ongoing assessment
- Done in real-time
- Adapts as situation changes
- Informs decision-making
- Not a written document
- Mental process

Purpose:
- Identify hazards and threats
- Evaluate level of risk
- Decide on appropriate response
- Protect self and others
- Justify actions taken

Process:
1. ASSESS - What is happening? What could happen?
2. CONSIDER - What are the options? What are the risks?
3. DECIDE - What action to take?
4. ACT - Implement the decision
5. REVIEW - Is it working? Reassess continuously

When to Use:
- Throughout every situation
- Constantly updating assessment
- Before, during, and after intervention
- Not just at start of incident

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.2.2: THREAT RECOGNITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of Threats:

VERBAL THREATS:
- Direct: "I'm going to hit you"
- Indirect: "You'll regret this"

PHYSICAL THREATS:
- Aggressive posture
- Brandishing weapon
- Moving towards you
- Positioning for attack

ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS:
- Confined spaces
- Multiple exit routes blocked
- Objects that could be weapons
- Slippery floors
- Poor lighting

Assessing Credibility of Threats:
- Capability: Can they carry out threat?
- Intent: Do they really mean it?
- Opportunity: Do they have the chance?
- History: Have they acted before?

Indicators of Imminent Attack:
- Target glance (looking at chin/throat)
- Weight shift (preparing to strike)
- Hand positioning (fists forming)
- Thousand-yard stare (emotional state)
- Removal of items (jacket, glasses)
- Sudden silence

- Apparent fitness level
- Known history
- Signs of intoxication
- Mental state

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.2.4: THE DANGER ZONES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reactionary Gap:
- Distance needed to react to attack
- Approximately 2-3 metres minimum
- More distance = more time to react
- Closer = higher risk

Personal Space Zones:

INTIMATE ZONE (0-45cm):
- Reserved for trusted people
- Entry by stranger = threatening
- High risk zone
- Very difficult to defend

PERSONAL ZONE (45cm-1.2m):
- Normal conversation distance
- Still close for strangers
- Be alert in this zone

SOCIAL ZONE (1.2m-3.6m):
- Professional interaction distance
- Safer for security work
- Time to react
- Maintain where possible

PUBLIC ZONE (3.6m+):
- General awareness
- Observation distance
- Lower immediate threat
- Best for initial assessment

Positioning:
- Keep safe distance
- Don't get cornered
- Maintain escape route
- Angle your stance (45 degrees)
- Keep barriers between you if possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 3.2.5: REDUCING RISK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Avoidance:
- Remove yourself from danger
- Withdraw if appropriate
- Not engaging unnecessarily
- Tactical repositioning

Creating Distance:
- Step back
- Move behind barrier
- Increase reactionary gap
- Gives time to think and react

Using Environment:
- Put objects between you

- Move towards colleagues/backup
- Move to CCTV coverage
- Move to better lighting

Calling for Backup:
- Don't wait until too late
