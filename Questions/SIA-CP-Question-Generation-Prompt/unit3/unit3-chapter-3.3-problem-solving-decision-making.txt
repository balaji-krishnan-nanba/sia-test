UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.3: PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What does SARA stand for in the problem-solving model?

A) Situation, Action, Review, Assessment
B) Scanning, Analysis, Response, Assessment
C) Security, Analysis, Response, Action
D) Scanning, Action, Review, Assessment

Correct Answer: B
