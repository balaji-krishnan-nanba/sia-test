THE EXAM
--------
Unit 2: Principles of Working as a Security Officer

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Security officers must understand the law to perform their duties effectively 
and legally. This includes understanding their powers and limitations, the 
difference between civil and criminal law, and specific offences they are 
likely to encounter. Legal knowledge protects both the security officer and 
their employer from liability.

UNIT 2, CHAPTER 2.2: LAW RELEVANT TO SECURITY OFFICERS
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the standard of proof required in criminal cases?

A) Balance of probabilities
B) Beyond reasonable doubt
C) Reasonable suspicion
D) Absolute certainty

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Criminal cases require proof "beyond reasonable doubt" - a 
higher standard than civil cases which use "balance of probabilities". This 
higher standard exists because criminal convictions can result in loss of 
liberty and serious consequences for the accused.
