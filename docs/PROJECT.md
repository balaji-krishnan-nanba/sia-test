## Executive Summary

**SIA Exam Prep** is a comprehensive web application designed to help candidates prepare for UK Security Industry Authority (SIA) licensing examinations. The platform provides practice questions, mock exams, progress tracking, and study materials for all four main SIA qualifications:

- **2,430+ verified practice questions** across 93 chapters
- **Intelligent mock exams** that mirror real SIA exam format
- **Progress tracking and analytics** to identify weak areas
