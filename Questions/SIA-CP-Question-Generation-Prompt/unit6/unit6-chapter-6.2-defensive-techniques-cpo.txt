SIA CLOSE PROTECTION - UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.2
DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR CPOs
================================================================================

YOUR TASK
---------
Generate 22 high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for Chapter 6.2 of 
the SIA Close Protection Operative Licence qualification.

Think deeply about each question. Consider:
- Is this what a real exam would ask?
- Is there genuinely only ONE correct answer?
- Would this help someone learn the material?
- Is the explanation clear and educational?

IMPORTANT: Distribute correct answers equally across A, B, C, D options.
Aim for approximately 5-6 questions with each letter as the correct answer.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT
================================================================================

THE QUALIFICATION
-----------------
Level 3 Certificate for Working as a Close Protection Operative within the
Private Security Industry

THE UNIT
--------
Unit 6: Physical Intervention Skills for Close Protection
- Assessment: Practical assessment
- Chapters: 5
- Practice Questions: 111 total
- This chapter (6.2) is one of 5 chapters in Unit 6

WHY THIS CHAPTER MATTERS
------------------------
Defensive techniques enable CPOs to protect themselves and their principals
when avoidance is not possible. Unlike offensive techniques, defensive skills
focus on blocking, deflecting, creating distance, and enabling evacuation
rather than incapacitating attackers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.2.2: BLOCKING TECHNIQUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of Blocks:
- Prevent strikes reaching target
- Protect yourself
- Protect principal

Types of Blocks:

HIGH BLOCK:
- Protects head and face

Blocking Principles:

DEFLECTION:
- Redirect force

- Use angles
- Economy of motion

TIMING:
- Early is better
- Meet attack early
- Don't wait until impact
- Anticipation helps

FOLLOW-UP:

- Create distance
- Prepare for next action
- Don't freeze after block

Cover Block:

WHAT IT IS:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.2.3: DEFLECTION AND REDIRECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deflection Principles:

REDIRECT FORCE:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.2.4: CREATING AND MAINTAINING DISTANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Distance Matters:

REACTION TIME:
- More distance = more time

- Time to evacuate

SAFETY:
- Out of immediate reach
- Reduced threat
- Options available
- Principal protection

Methods of Creating Distance:

PUSHING:
- Create separation
- Strong push to chest/shoulders
- Legal if defending
- Buys time

STRIKING (to create distance):
- If necessary
- Enables retreat
- Not to incapacitate (necessarily)
- Create space

FOOTWORK:
- Moving backward
- Lateral movement
- Taking angles
- Continuous movement

OBSTACLES:
- Put things between
- Tables, chairs, vehicles
- Use environment
- Delay attacker

Maintaining Distance:

AWARENESS:
- Know where threat is
- Monitor closing
- Adjust position
- Don't get cornered

MOVEMENT:
- Keep moving if needed
- Don't let them close
- Maintain reactionary gap
- Principal in mind

BARRIERS:
- Environmental barriers
- Team members
- Vehicles
- Any available obstacle

When Distance Fails:
- Close-quarters techniques needed
- Control techniques
- Strikes if necessary
- Immediate evacuation

Distance in Team Context:
- Team creates distance collectively
- Perimeter around principal
- Communication about threats
- Coordinated movement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC 6.2.5: RELEASES FROM GRABS AND HOLDS

UNIT 6, CHAPTER 6.2: DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR CPOs
================================================================================

Question 1 [Easy]
What is the correct stance for a CPO in a potential confrontation?

A) Square on, facing the threat directly
B) Bladed stance, approximately 45 degrees to the threat
C) Side on, presenting the back to the threat
D) Crouched low with hands on the ground

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The correct defensive stance is a bladed stance at 
approximately 45 degrees to the threat. This reduces the target area, 
allows for rapid movement in any direction, and enables quick defensive 
or offensive responses. The weight should be on the back foot, with 
knees slightly bent and hands visible above waist level.
