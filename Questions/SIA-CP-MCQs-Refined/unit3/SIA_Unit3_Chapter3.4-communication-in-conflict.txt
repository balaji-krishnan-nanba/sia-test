UNIT 3, CHAPTER 3.4: COMMUNICATION IN CONFLICT

Question 1 [Easy]
According to communication research used in this chapter, what percentage of a message is conveyed through body language?

A) 7%
B) 38%
C) 55%
D) 93%

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The commonly quoted breakdown is: words 7%, tone of voice 38%, and body language 55%. This highlights why non-verbal communication is crucial for a CPO in conflict – how you stand, move, and look often has more impact than the words themselves.

Question 2 [Easy]
Why is verbal communication especially important for a Close Protection Operative (CPO) in conflict situations?

A) It is the main tool for de‑escalating situations without using physical force
B) It completely removes the need for physical positioning and awareness
C) It guarantees that the principal will never become anxious
D) It is always more important than non‑verbal communication

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Verbal communication is the CPO’s primary tool for de‑escalation, giving instructions, building rapport and creating time, often avoiding the need for physical intervention. It must work alongside, not replace, positioning and body language.

Question 3 [Easy]
Which option best describes active listening in a conflict situation?

A) Waiting silently until you can give your instructions
B) Giving full attention, showing engagement and checking understanding
C) Repeating the other person’s words word‑for‑word
D) Using your radio earpiece to listen to your team

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Active listening means focusing on the speaker, showing you are engaged (verbally and non‑verbally), and clarifying understanding. It helps de‑escalate, builds rapport, and gathers information.

Question 4 [Easy]
Which statement best describes assertive communication?

A) Avoids conflict by not expressing your needs
B) Uses dominance and threats to gain compliance
C) Ignores the rights of others to achieve your aim
D) Is clear and direct while respecting your own and others’ rights

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Assertive communication is clear, direct and respectful. It differs from passive (not stating needs) and aggressive (ignoring others’ rights). A CPO must often be assertive when setting boundaries or giving instructions.

Question 5 [Easy]
During a sudden disturbance in a venue, which of the following is the most appropriate instruction to give your principal?

A) “If you could just calm down and maybe think about going over there…”
B) “You need to move somewhere else immediately, do you understand me?”
C) “Stay close. Follow me.”
D) “What do you think we should do now?”

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Instructions to the principal in conflict should be simple, direct and unambiguous, e.g. “Stay close”, “Follow me”, “This way”. Long, complex or emotionally loaded phrases are more likely to confuse or delay movement.

Question 6 [Easy]
When using radio communication during a conflict, how should a CPO generally speak?

A) Very fast, using long sentences to give full background
B) Briefly, using clear code words and standard procedures
C) Very quietly, even if the team struggle to hear
D) Emotionally and loudly, so the urgency is obvious

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Radio transmissions in conflict should be brief, clear and to the point, often using agreed codes and procedures. This keeps the channel free and ensures the whole team can understand and respond quickly.

Question 7 [Easy]
When working in another country where direct eye contact may be seen as disrespectful, what should a professional CPO do?

A) Research local customs and adapt eye contact accordingly
B) Use strong eye contact everywhere to show confidence
C) Avoid eye contact completely with everyone
D) Copy only whatever the principal does, ignoring local norms

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Cultural awareness is vital. Norms around eye contact vary, so a CPO should research and respect local customs while still maintaining professional communication and awareness.

Question 8 [Easy]
Which body position best represents a ready but non‑threatening stance in a conflict situation?

A) Standing square‑on, chest out, fists clenched
B) Hunched shoulders, looking at the ground
C) Standing very close with hands in pockets
D) Bladed stance with hands visible and an open posture

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A bladed stance with visible hands and an open posture is ideal. It is professional, gives balance and readiness, but avoids the aggressive signals of standing square‑on or clenching fists.

Question 9 [Medium]
An agitated guest at a private event is complaining loudly to venue security. You step in as the CPO. Which opening phrase is MOST likely to help de‑escalate the situation?

A) “Calm down, you’re being unreasonable.”
B) “Whatever, you can’t come in, end of discussion.”
C) “I understand you’re frustrated; help me understand what’s happened.”
D) “You need to walk away now before this gets worse.”

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Phrases like “calm down”, “you’re being…” or “whatever” are trigger words that often escalate conflict. Showing understanding and inviting them to explain (“Help me understand…”) is positive language that supports de‑escalation.

Question 10 [Medium]
While escorting your principal through a crowd, which behaviour MOST strongly suggests a potentially aggressive threat that needs closer attention?

A) Relaxed posture, open hands, smiling
B) Clenched jaw and fists, staring at the principal, rapidly closing distance
C) Arms folded, leaning on a wall, looking bored
D) Sitting down with head in hands, not looking up

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Clenched fists, fixed staring and rapid approach are classic pre‑attack indicators. They show possible intent to confront or assault, so the CPO should prioritise monitoring and managing this person.

Question 11 [Medium]
A hotel manager is angry about disruption caused by the principal’s entourage. Which response shows active listening and is most likely to calm the situation?

A) “So what you’re saying is the noise in the lobby is affecting other guests, is that right?”
B) “We don’t have time for this, we’re protecting a VIP.”
C) “Look, calm down, we’re leaving soon anyway.”
D) “That’s just how it is when famous people stay here.”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Restating the key point and checking (“is that right?”) is clarifying and summarising – core active listening skills. It shows the manager has been heard, which often reduces anger and opens the door to problem solving.

Question 12 [Medium]
A member of the crowd keeps stepping into the principal’s path to take photos despite previous warnings. Which statement is the MOST assertive and professional?

A) “If you don’t move, I’ll make you move.”
B) “Whatever, do what you want, it’s not my problem.”
C) “You’re being ridiculous, stop it now.”
D) “I need you to step back now and keep the walkway clear.”

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: “I” statements such as “I need you to…” are assertive: clear, direct and respectful. Threats and insults are aggressive; giving up is passive. Assertiveness is usually the most effective style for a CPO.

Question 13 [Medium]
During a fire alarm in a crowded venue, your principal freezes and refuses to move despite your clear instruction, “Follow me.” What is your BEST next action?

A) Raise your voice and shout “You need to move NOW!” directly in their face
B) Leave the principal briefly to clear the route and return
C) Repeat a simple instruction calmly while using gentle physical guidance to start them moving
D) Ask venue staff to take over while you check the exit

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Panic and confusion can block compliance. The CPO should stay calm, repeat clear, simple instructions and, where appropriate, use professional physical guidance to move the principal, without abandoning them.

Question 14 [Medium]
An aggressive male suddenly approaches quickly from the left side of your formation. Which team communication is MOST appropriate as you move to protect the principal?

A) “Threat somewhere over there!” while pointing
B) “Contact left!” followed by a brief description over radio or voice
C) “Everyone, be careful!”
D) Stay silent to avoid alarming the principal

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Standard contact calls such as “Contact left!” plus a brief description give the team clear direction and allow a coordinated response. Vague warnings or silence reduce the team’s ability to react effectively.

Question 15 [Medium]
You are working in a country where people normally stand closer together when speaking. A local VIP steps much closer to you than usual while talking, but there is no immediate threat. What is the MOST appropriate response?

A) Accept the reduced distance if safe, recognising different cultural norms
B) Step back immediately to your preferred distance, even if it appears rude
C) Gently push them back with your hand to create more space
D) Tell them loudly, “You’re too close, please move back.”

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Personal space expectations differ between cultures. If safety is not compromised, the CPO should adapt to local norms rather than risk causing offence, while still maintaining a professional stance and awareness.

Question 16 [Medium]
At an outdoor concert, loud music makes it difficult for a distressed bystander near the principal to hear your instructions. What is the BEST way to overcome this communication barrier?

A) Shout as loudly as possible from your current position
B) Ignore them and focus only on radio communications
C) Use more technical language so they concentrate harder
D) Move them a short distance to a quieter area if safe, using clear gestures to support your words

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Noise is a physical barrier. Where possible, move to a quieter spot and support verbal messages with clear non‑verbal signals. Simply shouting more is less effective and may add to stress.

Question 17 [Hard]
You are escorting your principal out of a nightclub. A drunk patron, shouting that he has been pushed, starts moving towards you, jabbing his finger in your direction. The principal is directly behind you. Which combination of verbal and non‑verbal behaviour is MOST appropriate?

A) Step square‑on into his space, point back at him and say, “You need to calm down right now.”
B) Stand side‑on but fold your arms and look away while saying, “Whatever, it’s not my problem.”
C) Adopt a bladed stance with hands visible, maintain calm eye contact and say, “I can see you’re angry. Let’s step over here and talk.”
D) Move behind the principal and let venue security handle it without speaking to the patron

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The CPO should stay between threat and principal, using a bladed, non‑threatening stance, visible hands and calm tone. Acknowledging emotion (“I can see you’re angry”) and suggesting movement away are de‑escalating. Pointing, “you need to…” and “whatever” are trigger phrases that escalate.

Question 18 [Hard]
During a hostile protest, your team suddenly lose radio communications due to interference. The principal must be moved to a secondary exit immediately. What is the BEST way to maintain coordination?

A) Each team member chooses their own route out independently to avoid being targeted
B) Use pre‑agreed hand signals and rally points to regroup and move the principal according to the contingency plan
C) Stop moving until radios come back online to avoid confusion
D) Ask the principal which way they prefer to go and follow their lead

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When communications fail, the team should fall back on pre‑planned, non‑verbal methods such as hand signals, rally points and pre‑agreed actions. Training and contingency plans allow coordinated movement even without radios.

Question 19 [Hard]
An explosion is heard nearby on a busy street. You move the principal into a doorway for cover. They are shaking and asking, “What’s happening? Are we safe?” You must call emergency services. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action and opening statement on the call?

A) Stay close to the principal and say calmly, “Police and ambulance to [exact location]; explosion heard, possible casualties, threat unknown.”
B) Move several metres away from the principal to get a better signal and explain their celebrity status
C) Spend the first minute explaining to the principal what you think has happened, then call emergency services
D) Hand your phone to the principal and ask them to explain the situation while you watch the crowd

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The CPO must keep the principal safe while calling for help. The first priority on the call is clear location and what is happening (explosion, possible casualties, ongoing threat). Detailed background and identities are secondary.

Question 20 [Hard]
You are dealing with a disgruntled ex‑employee who is arguing loudly near the vehicle while the principal waits inside. You must listen to him but also scan for other threats. How should you best combine active listening with protective awareness?

A) Maintain constant eye contact and full focus on him, ignoring the surroundings to show respect
B) Keep looking around and say nothing while he talks so you can watch for threats
C) Interrupt frequently with closed questions so the conversation ends quickly
D) Use brief attending behaviours (facing him, occasional eye contact, minimal encouragers) while also visually scanning and relying on team support for wider security

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In Close Protection, active listening must be balanced with situational awareness. Short encouragers, some eye contact and clarifying questions can be used while still scanning the environment and working with the team to protect the principal.
